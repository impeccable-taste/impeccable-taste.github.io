## your friend, hohito :(
I like watching movies, petting dogs and praising Satan. I also like talking about those things.

## What an Impeccable Taste!
Let's be honest, I have some objectively great opinions about stuff, I'm that lucky. Some people take things too seriously so I figured we could strip reviews down to the most important thing: bad jokes, hot takes and making fun of IMDB user content.<br/>
And so.

## And so.
I try to watch at least a new movie every week. By "new" I mean "new to me": a movie I haven't watched before no matter when it was released. If I can't make it one week, I can eventually catch up watching two new movies in the future. Let's face it, the rules here are an excuse to say I win. There are also some extra rules in certain parts of the year, like the Spooktober Challenge, but the most basic concept is just that: watch a new movie, talk about it.

This blog is going to be used as a **Knowledge Vault** so future generations can learn what the great minds of our century thought about important stuff. Think of the Library of Alexandria, but more focused on horror movies and bad takes.
