I like watching movies, reading books, listening to music, petting dogs and praising Satan, our lord and master. I also like talking about those things, and I have some objectively great opinions about stuff.

Every year the resolution is to watch at least one movie I haven't watched before every week, read one book I haven't read before every month and so on. I mean I already listen to way too much music, pet all dogs and hail satan constantly so we're okay in that department.

This blog is going to be used as a Knowledge Vault so future generations can learn what the great minds of our century thought about stuff. More or less.
