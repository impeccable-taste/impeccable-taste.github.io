<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> We are off to a bad start because Jeff, our main dude, is an influencer. More specifically, he's one of those guys whose channel is about going somewhere, ordering food and then spends a few minutes telling you how this new concept, "french fries", is lifechanging.<br/>What I'm saying is that he's a really obnoxious person like basically all influencers in the universe.<br/> ANYHOO, recently his dad died **and** a bit after that our friend Jeff A) got an offer from The Food Network to, maybe, get a pilot for a new show and B) he also took one of those DNA scams where they tell you you're super white and also a bit scottish, and he found out his dead dad had had another son, the titular Andy.<br/>Surprisingly, what follows is a horror movie, not one of those lifetime films that are designed to take a nap to.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yup! 70something very tight minutes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, unfortunately.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> There's an amazing moment near the beginning of the movie where our boy Andy brings a couple of personalized t-shirts with each brother's face on them + a bad joke and I found that so funny that I am ready to forgive most of this movie's flaws.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> What if ***Creep*** had an even lower budget is a pretty big self-imposed challenge and yet this movie manages to, all things considered, do an okay job at that. Yeah yeah you know where things are going from very early, some of the situations are basically like "what the hell is even happening here" *and yet* I found this movie really endearing. There's something nice about films made by literally three people that feel kinda earnest *and* self aware at the same time.<br/>Also, Jeff is an absolute asshole and a bully, what the hell.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Andy should have prepared more t-shirts (one for each day) with crappier and crappier jokes. Like, the first one was "save a horse / ride this cowboy" and I think we can go way way dumber than that.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> On three separate occasions police were called on the two main actors by onlookers who thought that the action was real.

One of the signs of a really good movie, see? Sure sure you like ***The Godfather***, but did they call the police on Marlo Brandon, Punky Brewster's dog? Yeah I thought so.
