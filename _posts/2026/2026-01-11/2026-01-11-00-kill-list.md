<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Jay is a dude that looks extremely dorky, and also he is a hitman. Okay that came out weird but anyway: he really looks like a dork. Anyway so he and his friend Gal take some contracts every now and then to pay the bills, what with being ex-army and stuff, and this time they're supposed to get rid of three dudes. But, wait, if you are one of the weirdos that look at the tags on your favourite blog you might have noticed that [folk horror]({% link tags/folk-horror/index.html %}) is there? What the-?!<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> nah, five minutes more<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes th- oh wait, no, they don't!

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeah this was creepy. I've had this one on my watchlist since it was first out, but I guess I needed uh 15 years to get to it. Anyway, it starts like just a gritty UK crime film, but from the get go you can tell there are some things that are just a bit off. Then they keep getting off...offer? Weirder. And sure the guys are ex-army so you kinda take for granted that they're a bit detached... but then our main guy keeps getting more and more unhinged and yup, you wouldn't invite him to a dinner party. Anyway, yeah, fun watch, very disturbing at times, boy do horror movies love their hammers, etc.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> For some reason the guy that hires them for their hits reminded me of Joe Biden, but with slightly longer hair. I kinda feel it'd be a very fun movie if for some reason Mr Biden was there just like, hiring a british dork and his irish friend to etc etc etc, you know?

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The garden where Jay is seen burying their murdered cat actually contained several buried cats.

Dude, that garden must be megahaunted but in a really bad way...
