<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> So a dude finds a tape. There is more to the movie, I promise! For example, he starts a crappy youtube channel that looks like all of those creepypasta things, except in his case there's something to dig into this time around. Much more the moment his sister joins in on the scavenger's hunt, and *much* more when things start to get seriously weird. Like people blacking out when they watch certain parts of a tape or whatever.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Ayup!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yeah, it's the name of the youtube-channel-inside-the-documentary-inside-the-movie

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span> That's a lot of cameras with some very selective low/high resolution, I tell you hwat.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeah, this was fun. It didn't really stick the landing but the first half is definitely a very fun, intriguing watch. The mystery and how the main characters are putting all the pieces together? Great stuff. Then it just kind of resolves everything pretty quickly and mmmm there's a bit too much responsibility resting on the shoulders of this not-that-great actor, but what can you do. Sometimes it's about the journey there I suppose.<br/>Also if you're like me and you share my thoughts and feelings about found footage, you know I actually really liked this movie and I'm trying to sound a bit objective. I mean sure it's not the best but it tries to do fun stuff and I can forgive the other bits.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> There were some surprisingly competent vfx scenes (specially for what must have been a budget of about two bucks), the first of them actually took me completely by surprise because I really didn't expect the movie to go in that direction. I'd like a bit more of that - still within the budget limitations of course, but just embrace this kind of "this is the movie we are in, now" situation.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ letterboxd reviews:</span>

there is a review that gives the movie three out of five stars and only says "girls, don't eat raw potatoes". I don't have a clue what's going on here but at least they must have liked it, I guess?
