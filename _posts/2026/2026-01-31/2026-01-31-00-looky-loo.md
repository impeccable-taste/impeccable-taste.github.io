<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> It looks like someone's bought a GoPro and like about 95% of all GoPro buyers they've realized they have no use for the thing after the first week! Instead of learning how to do sick tricks with his skateboard, our dude decides it's more fun to document his crimes and film how he goes inside some women's houses, how he is never noticed, how he sometimes kills them, blabla. You know, the usual stuff you do with a GoPro camera.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> ... sorta? They do not, but the main character kinda types it on screen and, look, there's literally just two lines of dialogue in the movie, total, so i'm going to count this one as "yes"

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Eeeeuhm. So it's not a secret I like found footage movies, I think it's a format that lets directors and writers be really creative even if they only have like the crappiest camera and some friends to film something. I'm a bit conflicted with this one, though. On one hand I'd be lying if I said it didn't get tense and *really* unsettling at some points, like, there's this sense of dread during the whole runtime and at times you feel *wrong* for being implicitely an accomplice ("it's a metaphor, d'uh"? "why you keep watching, then?" and so on). On the other hand, this is one of the most pointless movies I've watched recently. Like, *sure* if you want you can go on a deep dive and try to psychoanalize what's happening and how this very specific victim is "saved for last" or whatever but in the end this is a movie where you are just seeing someone breaking into other people houses, being a creep and sometimes killing them. I guess I didn't like it as much as I could have.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I think it'd be fun if at least *once* in the whole movie someone actually had some peripheral vision and would notice some movement when they're washing dishes right by the window where the killer is, but if we can't have that i'll settle for a very very simple change that'd definitely make the movie more enjoyable: give the dude Clown Shoes, the kind that squeak when you walk.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>

Nearly all the reviews mentioned ***In A Violent Nature*** and I kinda take offense at that because this is not that movie in any way.
