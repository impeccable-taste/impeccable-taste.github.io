<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Pete Campbell from ***Mad Men*** has a car accident while driving through the middle of nowhere and ends up having to spend the night with this really weird couple where the guy seems to be kind of encouraging him to go to bed with his wife.<br/>I know what you are thinking but no, your favourite blog is not starting to review cuckold porn, don't worry, this is a sort of... blend of sci-fi/conspiracy thriller/psychological horror movie that involves some little boxes that play this buzzing sound and people acting out and... And surprisingly it only gets weirder after that, but that isn't a bad thing at all!<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope, a bit over that<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No... they say "the sound", "the frequency" but not the magic word, tsk.

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Trust me, you won't really guess where this one is going from the initial like ten minutes. I had a *lot* and I mean **a lot** of fun with this one. Usually when movies seem to be so focused on the whole "mystery box" kind of thing they tend to be a bit disappointing no matter if you can guess anything or not, this one I think was really satisfying. For once I didn't really mind the extra like 15 minutes over the golden duration. Very very entertaining, something tells me this one will be a fun rewatch too to see the little breadcrumbs.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> there's a pregnancy subplot, but the movie should add a little disclaimer like "no, no, the title's not about that". Or, wait... uh.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about ~~the IMDb trivia~~ your favourite blog:</span>

No trivia or anything fun on IMDb so have some trivia about me watching this movie: I spent the whole film thinking "who the hell is this guy?" and "I know that woman but from *where*?", and *for once* I didn't pause the movie to check wikipedia or anything like that because I was concerned that'd would kinda spoil something like "oh, this person actually plays Evilyn McBaddie" or whatever. This took all of my willpower. Also the wikipedia page doesn't spoil anything on the cast section, you're okay if you check it.
