<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Meet Ian. Things you should know about Ian: he is an absolute dork, he is clearly trying to process... something, whatever it is, he is a kiwi and also he's for some reason decided to go trekking. Like, not just "oh let's go for a walk, Martha", more like "okay this route takes several days into the wilderness, and besides,". Also, Ian clearly has never gone trekking before in his life. Ah, and he thinks *someone* or *something* is following him. And for some reason he is meeting the most obnoxious people on earth on his way. And it's obvious he's just some kind of weirdo with mental issues, except...<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Almost, nope. Should I change this to 100 minutes, I wonder? No, I mustn't. I shan't!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nnnope.

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> okay yeah let's talk about the "almost there, not really, but almost, but not really" kind of flawed movie we're dealing with. Or maybe I should say "movies", because this time there are two very, *very* different movies going on, one that lasts for about an hour, another one that gets the last part of the runtime. And both are really good and fun and sometimes very darkly funny! But there's some big friction when you try to mix the two, which sucks.<br/>That said, and as usual with our modus operandi, let's focus on the positive: the first part is an exercise in how to film paranoia. It's mostly about our friend Ian being a weirdo that seems to think there's just *something* there out of frame, and long pauses where you *almost, **almost*** can see some shadow or silhouette, but the camera angle changes just when you're about to think "huh." and the film continues. Amazingly compelling, trust me! More positives: the second part of the movie is Fun, with a capital F, and over the top and it's so full of practical effects that, given the obvious low budget, makes you want to nod and go "good job, my friends, good job". It is just such a bummer that they really feel like two different movies, otherwise.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> let's have a crossover with ***In A Violent Nature***, *now*.
