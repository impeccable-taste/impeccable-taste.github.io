<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Meet Geoff, a genetics researcher who divorced kinda recently-ish after his kid died basically a few days after being born and is kind of trying to find some cure for that illness. He's just started to work on Germany with an ex-pupil-slash-ex-fling so things look really bad already from the start, but at least she's found some really interesting research topic because she's somehow found some gene or whatever that gives you Wolverine's healing factor. There's also this megabald dude that is creepy as hell and thinking about how cool it'd be to like release some sort of weird mosquitos with vaccines instead of malaria and eh, things get worse from there I guess, but the movie's not actually about that. Anyway.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope, ten minutes more<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Aaaaaalmost but not really, which is a shame!

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

![](errors-of-the-human-body.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeaaaaah so I guess this one is on me, but anyway: when I found this film the summary said it was a body horror movie, and for the first like two thirds of the runtime it really feels like it's going to, well, go there. As in, the main character even looks slightly like Toxie for some minutes and if you're like me you're like "hell yeah, science gone wrong we should not have played gods etc haha hubris". Buuuuut no. Like, if you remove the couple of bloody scenes and so on this film, it could perfectly be just an afternoon drama/thriller and that's that. Also, some of the actors were uh not great and at times it felt like the dialogue had been written by someone whose first language wasn't English, but I mean, stone, glass house. Eh.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> there's this japanese dude that only appears on two really short scenes, on one of them he talks about how flies dream of the smell of bananas and, honestly, that was surprisingly wholesome so more of that, please.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb ~~trivia~~ user reviews:</span>
> ⭐ **4/10**
> **Found a script**
>
> Feels like someone found the 2/4's part of the script in the woods somewhere but didnt have the rest- decided to make the movie anyway and got lost.

I guess that's a way more succinct way to put it, yeah.
