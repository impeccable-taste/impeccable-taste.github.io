<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This is the Old West! Lizzy and her husband Isaak move to The Fifth Pine (New Mexico) and basically live on their own until this other weird couple ("other" as in "Lizzy and her husband are kinda weird too"), Emma and Gideon, move to the cabin next door. "Next Door" in this case basically means a few miles away, but anyway, that's not important. What's important, though, is that Emma thinks a demon or something like that is after her unborn child and well, this is a horror movie so of course, so maybe there *are* demons, or something, or witches? It's spooky out there. And sorta windy.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes! Yes!!

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

![oooh it's the titular wind!](the-wind.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Okay yeah. I usually am not a fan of anything involving "demons" or whatever but this movie was pretty cool and eerie. Maybe it's because it had been a while since I had last watched some "western horror", maybe because the lead actress is pretty good, maybe because the movie is really eerie? The important bit is, this was a fun watch and I liked it. Very creepy stuff.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> This movie features a goat and not only it is cute (like all goats), it also plays a cool part. Maybe we should have had a crossover with ***The VVitch***'s Black Phillip and start the Goatverse of Madness or whatever.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The cabin that the couple lives in is far too luxurious (by the standards of that time and place) to be credible. Multiple glass windows, multiple glass lamps (that use kerosene, which in turn has to be bought at the store many days away in town), multiple feather pillows, doors with real hinges instead of leather strips: all of this indicated more wealth than the couple could have earned from their farm. And a non-wealthy couple wouldn't have been living out there.
