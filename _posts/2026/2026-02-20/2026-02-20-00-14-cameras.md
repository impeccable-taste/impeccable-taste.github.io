<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Yup, you guessed it: this is the sequel to [***13 Cameras***]({% post_url 2025/2025-12-29/2025-12-29-00-13-cameras %}) and as you might guess that means one thing and one thing only: this time there's an extra camera around...<br/>Okay, well, yeah, it's about this extremely creepy landlord (but I repeat myself hur hur) who is filming some family and most specifically the teenage daughter and her friend, who also has some women kidnapped and yeah blabla dark web blabla.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Either that or a tiny bit less than that.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> They... type it on screen at some point, which I guess counts. They also say some of the alternate titles, so, uhm. Yeah this one counts.

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> So first things first, I liked this movie a bit more than the first one. Maybe it's because we don't focus so much on the lifetime-movie-sque family conflict this time, maybe it's because we get to see the creeplord lurching around, whatever. At the same time it is also kind of both trying to be more of a commentary thing while at the same time it could have a huge neon display saying "this movie, very clearly written by a dude". It also has this issue where there are three separate movies in one in terms of how graciously each subplot is related to the others. *But*. It was fun, creepy and very unsettling too. That landlord sure is disturbing, I tell you hwat.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> seriously, stop teasing me about how bad this dude smells but only bringing it up like, twice. Make it a fundamental part of the script, have people gag and retch when they're being killed or whatever. Make a point of everyone making faces if they walk where he's walked, etc etc etc.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>

Perplexingly confusing way to say "this is a sequel".
