<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Two stories intertwined: on one hand we have a kinda goofy looking photographer/serial killer who we see being a creep and eventually worse than a creep. On the other hand we've got Anna Kendrick, an aspiring actress who accepts participating on a tv show for exposure. The tv show is one of those cheesy ones where a cute lady asks questions and eventually chooses a bachellor.<br/>You won't believe who bachellor #3 is!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> five minutes over the mark... tsk tsk.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes they do!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> that parking lot scene was TENSE.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Yeah, this one is a strong recommend, even if like me you know about the based-on-a-true-story plot points. Really solid movie.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I want Anna Kendrick to ask more uncomfortable questions and definitely more of bachellor #1 making an absolute fool of himself!!!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> Almost everything about the "Dating Game" TV taping was fictionalized for dramatic effect.
- In the film, Rodney Alcala sits in the last chair as Bachelor #3. In real life, he was bachelor #1.
- [a million more examples of small changes as important as that one]

My friend here making sure they show everyone why on that [***Red Rooms***]({% post_url 2025-01-20/2025-01-20-00-red-rooms %}) review I said you shouldn't trust people who are way, way too into true crime and they need to tell everyone about it...
