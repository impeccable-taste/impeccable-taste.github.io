<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This young lady with a drinking problem put an ad on the paper so she can meet other people with drinking issues that think they have a ghost around and give them closure. The title is Spanish for "There are no ghosts".<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 15 minutes, actually.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yep, in stereo where available.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> cute short story where my issues are with the performance of two out of three characters.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Perfectly cromulent, there are worse ways to spend 15 minutes.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Let's make sure our main actors do not talk like they are kids that memorized their script.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDB trivia~~ credits:</span><br/>Apparently the third character (the one not mentioned in the premise section) was in ***The Ministry of Time*** and I was like "aaaah that's where I know him from" and then I was like "*wait, i never watched that show*" and now i don't know who he reminds me of?? Hm.
