<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Near the beginning of WWII this british priest who is kind of scared of intimacy with his wife moves to a huge ass manor with her and their adoptive daughter (dorter) to take care of it and the parish I guess. The last family living at the big house disappeared in mysterious circumstances and (would you believe this) *they were also a priest + wife combo*...!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> No.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Seriously, if your dorter starts doing weird creepy rituals with dolls it is maybe about time you talk to her.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> The lady does a very good job but not enough to save it, unfortunately. Give it a pass.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> It really could use without one out of the ten or twenty different plot threads it tries to go for. Sometimes simpler is better.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span><br/>
Apparently this is called ***El Exorcismo*** in Spanish according to IMDB, which means it would be *impossible* to tell this movie apart from a thousand other ones called basically the same thing. Good work!
