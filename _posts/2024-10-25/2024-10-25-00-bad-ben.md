<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Tom just bought a home at a sheriff's sale, he wants to clean it up a little and flip it. He is recording some sort of video log showing the repairs where he comes through as the dorkiest dude this side of the 8-bit guy, except with less guns and from new jersey.<br/>
There is a thing Tom wasn't counting on - would you believe the house is HAUNTED!?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes...! YES!
{% include bison-yes-yes.html %}

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> unlike any other horror movie protagonist Tom is literally afraid of no ghosts and he takes no shit from them at all.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> This is a hilariously low budget marvel where the whole crew is just this guy at his own home talking to himself and being so genuinely annoyed at the house being haunted. like, "oh, god*DAMN* it. Shit."<br/>It's literally this book:<br/>
![man, fuck this house](fork-this-house.png)

Amazing.

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I was going to say "make more of this" but it turns out there are about sixteen. Hello, future project!
