<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Meg (not a giant moster) is a kidnapping survivor that is trying to go back to normal after being released. Understandably she is still anxious and recovering. She and her husband decide to go to his family's home in cape cod, where they meet the husband's increasingly annoying and standoffish cousin who keeps inviting herself to basically every single dinner because she cannot take a hint.<br/>
More or less that's when she starts to notice how a lot of things feel off and not just because she just keeps being around.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, what the hell?

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> honestly, I am very conflict adverse but even I would have had way less patience than Meg about everything.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> I thought it was entertaining but I was told this was horror. This was just a thriller, maybe it was like, one of those movies you "watch" while napping after lunch.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> the same movie, but Meg is now a kaiju. No other changes and nobody comments on it.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> After the motorcycle crash the helmet didn't have a scratch on it.
