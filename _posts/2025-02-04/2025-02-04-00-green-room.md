<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> so these crusty punks get an accidental last-minute gig at a neo nazi bar and the first thing they do is play the national anthem, ***Nazi Punks Fuck Off***, which already gives this movie like a nine out of ten if we were actually giving scores here at **Impeccable Taste**.<br/>
Oh right, they also accidentally witness a crime scene and suddenly it's like Fight for your Life, Charlie Brown.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Almost, but no.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes they do! AND it is obviously a key part of the film.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

![nazi punks fuck off](green-room.gif)

<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Okay this was way, *way* better than it had any right to be and it goes directly to the "I need to rewatch this crap" list. Fun script, the crusties are great, it is actually really unsettling, tense and chilling even though it doesn't go as far on the gore as you'd maybe expect. And of course there's Sir Patrick Stewart playing extremely against type and being *really* scary just by being a really polite, quiet guy.<br/>
And that must be one of the best last lines of any movies I've watched recently.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> since the movie already has a great soundtrack featuring no dodgy bands, I say we bring in Jonathan Frakes to constantly question Sir Patrick Stewart life choices.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> The revolver that is handled by the group in the movie is a snub nose Taurus Raging Bull.

Thank you, Weird Internet Gun Guy. This is very interesting trivia, please tell me more. I am so hyped about gun stuff, it really paints you as a normal person  (*stealthily trying to call the police while inching away*)
