<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> On one hand there's a serial killer on the loose... and he's been targetting couples during Valentine's Day for a couple of years now, which is kind of sad if you think about it.<br/>Meanwhile, after a quick meet-cute with a hunktastic dude at the coffee shop, our plucky protagonist is about to be fired from her job as a copywriter for a jewelry company! It turns out that in an extremely tone-deaf move she chose to base the whole campaign idea around "love that ends in tragedy". Tsk, not the best timing. The company hires a freelancer that is apparently a big deal... and guess who the dude is?<br/>Wait, no, I'm not implying the dude's the killer. I would not spoil the movie so openly - *or would I????*<br/>Anyhoo, yes, this is a film that tries to go both for slasher and one of those lifetime movies you sleep through after lunch on the weekends.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> juuuuust a bit over the mark, but no.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes, they do!

<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Okay, so this reminded me a lot of Eli Roth's ***Thanksgiving***, a movie that was a really welcome surprise, and I think I could get behind the whole revival of the dumb holiday horror movie. I'd say ***Thanksgiving*** was the better movie although they both are really funny, or maybe I was in exactly the right mood to laugh at the bad jokes. The kills are both dumb and over the top, which at times felt welcome considering I've watched a lot of movies recently that clearly were very reluctant to keep filming the gory bit. Sure, it doesn't completely stick the landing (the "romcom" bits sometimes go for a bit too long and *sometimes* they wink a bit too much at the audience), but I think it's still a fun watch.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I would have liked more of the horrible horrible boss lady, it's a pity she's only in the movie for like two minutes.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Detective Hobbs is played by Devon Sawa, a horror movie legend who's known for being ***Casper the friendly ghost*** and Alex Browning in ***The Final Destination*** series.
