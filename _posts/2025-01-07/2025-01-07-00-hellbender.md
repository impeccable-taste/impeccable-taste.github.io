<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This mom and daughter not only are part of a sort of metal band, they also live deep in the forest with barely any contact with the outside world - very, very trve existence. But maybe there are some secrets between them? I was going to make a joke about the trvth and messed it up, ugh. Still, a very witchy existence that we can only aspire to.<br/>Unless...!?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes, 86 minutes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> They do!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Raw veganism was a clue that something was going to be very wrong.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> That was fun! Really cool visuals at times, too.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> It should have been a black metal band, not a whatever that was. It's the thought that counts, though.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> Sneakers disappear from a shot to another. When mother comes back from the store and met her daughter sit in de Stairs, daughter was using All Star Sneakers. Mother left the car and sit one stair below her daughter and now, daughter is barefoot and the Sneakers not even near them.

To quote Kevin Malone, "why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?"<br/>
Additionally, you know you've messed up when the Weird Foot Guys start taking notes about your movie.
