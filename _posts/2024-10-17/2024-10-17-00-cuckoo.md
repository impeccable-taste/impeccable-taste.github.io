<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> After the death of her mother, Gretchen moves with her estranged dad, stepmom and their stepdorter to this picturesque bavarian resort where nothing out of the ordinary would ever happen.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Just barely over the limit but, alas they chose poorly.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yup! Although not in a dramatic enough way.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> As usual, be wary if someone has a German accent and/or insists on being called "*herr/herrin [name]*" **AND** that name is not Arnold.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> I loved the general weirdness and eventual crazyness on display, but i would understand if people Hatedhatedhated this one.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Add a flute/recorder battle of the bands scene between the doctor and Dwight Schrute.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> Gretchen [...] enters a room with a sign showing opening hours. On the lower end of this sign it reads 'Keine Kunde erlaubt' in German, which translates to 'No customer(s) allowed'. This sentence is grammatically incorrect. In German it would either be 'Kein Kunde' (singular) or 'Keine Kunden' (plural), but 'Keine Kunde' uses the plural 'no' and the singular 'customer'.

This note definitely written by a German or (goodness gracious) an Austrian.
