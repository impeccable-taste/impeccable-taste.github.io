<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> So Belinda (Belinderr?) is a very pregnant lady who, along with the Doormant Elemental he calls "husband‚Äù,
house. We're told they're hardly making ends meet. *Anyhoo*, stuff happens and the husband's extremely old and ill, extremely religious in a creepy "*speaks in tongues*" way, extremely southern, extremely racist stepmom (but i repeat myself hur hur) unilaterally decides to move in with them. Oh, Belinderr is black btw, I forgot to say.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 95 minutes, almost but nope.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yup, they do! Although the titular front room is not as pivotal as you'd think.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> They end a very tense scene with a loud, loud fart.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> honestly it's not great but it's so dumb it's funny, I had a great time! The grandma is revolting, that's some amazing casting.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I'd say lean in more on the farts angle but they already did so, well. Here we are, no notes.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>

Let's see what the user reviews at IMDB think of this movie!

For some reason I feel like bumping the score up now.
