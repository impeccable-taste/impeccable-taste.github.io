<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Our main guy is a canadian dude living in Japan. Of course Japanese law is very clear about it: if you live there and you're from abroad you must have a youtube channel. So he does have one where he posts uh paranormal stuff. Then one day he finds this old abandoned house in the middle of nowhere (anime translator note: specifically in どこにもの真ん中) which would already be kind of the shit i watch on youtube but there's, surprise, the titular Woman in the Chair. A ghost, we're told! Very spooky stuff! So spooky this weird couple that very clearly is into some cuckolding stuff wants to finance the channel and all that and why not make some kind of turist attraction and...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> yeah, eighty.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> well yes, they do.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I mean, you can't say they didn't deliver on the promise.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Uuuuuh. This is kind of a big mess. It is extremely low budget (laudatory), to the point where you start to think "hey, is this just some kind of like, activity for expats living in japan?". Really "I'm just reciting my lines" kind of performances there, in a sense that's kinda charming. But the movie itself and specially the script is... oof. Yeah.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> We are told anyone going into that room with the woman in the chair feels some intense dread and fear! Then whenever anyone goes in they move the camera away because why bother with showing if you can tell. Maybe we could use the medium to our advantage, so the pictures on screen let us enjoy/be terrified by what is happening, for example.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>

No trivia. I like, though, that the tags for the movie are *Business* and *Woman*. Very useful stuff, although I am missing *Chair* and maybe *the*.
