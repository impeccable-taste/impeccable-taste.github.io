<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Mia is an extremely annoying influencer who somehow has been invited to a hugeass airbnb place to spend the weekend. She's going there with her group of obnoxious friends who also happen to be influencers and she decides to press the "start stream now!" button on her phone. A weekend to DIE for?!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> a minute over that<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> oh, yeah, they are constantly talking about it.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span><br/>![JUST KEEP FILMING](livestream.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> A few years ago I watched ***Deadstream*** an excellent horror comedy with a similar premise ("dumb as fuck youtuber goes to a haunted house and never stops streaming his stupidity, all while trying to keep the chat engaged") and I think I've been chasing the same high ever since. It wasn't even the first movie I had watched with the same premise, but it was very funny.<br/>Well, this movie wasn't that at all!<br/> In this specific case they do literally nothing with the gimmick other than imitate other movies that did. For example, the chat on the right side of the screen is really distracting but the characters never engage with it (one of them "justifies" it in the movie by saying they don't read the chat "because of the haters", but come on, at that point just drop the chat altogether). The plot was paper thin, the "scares" were dumb as hell and the acting was horrible. I guess at this point it's starting to be my fault because I keep making the same mistake again and again, but please re-read the bit about ***Deadstream*** and then go watch it if you haven't done so.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> You didn't need to have *several* minutes long scenes of "literally nothing happens because we're just pointing the camera at a corpse/catatonic person/the floor". A movie can be 70 minutes long and that's okay!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb ~~trivia~~ summary:</span>
> As a team of livestreamers embark on a haunted house challenge, they quickly realize that the scares may be more real than they anticipated.

This is the official summary of this movie. There's no haunted house challenge, at no point there's any mention of the place being haunted, ghosts or whatever. There's a dumb challenge between the group of friends but it's just about the number of viewers.<br/>The main reason I wanted to watch the movie was "oooh cool haunted house thing, nice" so I felt a bit disappointed.
