<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> After a pretty rough spell, Robert and Maia decide to move from London to her little childhood town. Immediately things start looking a bit weird because everyone's kind of offputting, but anyway, that's what happens if you are a character in a horror movie. The thing is, one day Robert finds a pretty old portrait in the attic and wouldn't you know it, it looks just like him! Robert, being a really bad judge of character decides to investigate, instead of just saying "okay so I guess that's that" and leaving forever.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 89 minutes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes, they do!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> It sucks because this movie had a lot of stuff I really like and find very creepy (starting with the ominous portrait and the whole way the investigation feels like some "weird horror" pulpy short story) but then decides to do nothing with it, agh!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span><br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> this movie would be way better without trying to go for the *twisteeeed* and *edgyyyyy* twist and just focus on the creepy idea of finding a portrait of you, except well dressed.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ yours truly:</span>

Surprisingly there wasn't any trivia or goofs or whatever when I checked IMDb so instead I'll let whoever reads this know that my sister recently bought a pretty old house and she found a portrait (that she hasn't touched yet) in the basement. I've watched enough movies to let her know she should not:
- touch it
- uncover it
- get rid of it

Until a certified expert goes by her house. And by certified expert I mean me, because I'm definitely grabbing that the first time I visit and bringing it to *my* home. The goal here is obviously to get megahaunted and I think this is really a step in the right direction.

Obviously if one day this blog stops updating it's not that I've got tired of it, it just means I'm busy being ultracursed and stuff like that.
