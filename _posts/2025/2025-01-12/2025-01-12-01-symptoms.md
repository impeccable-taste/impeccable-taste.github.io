<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Helen invites her friend to spend the weekend with her in this old manor in the forest, by the lake. The typical, traditional English estate that is remote enough people won't find out if something weird happens.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> a couple of minutes over the limit.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> yes!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I am going to admit I was (pleasantly?) surprised by how not-sleazy this was, all things considered!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> that was surprisingly surreal and fun, even if it was a slow as hell movie.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Instead of inviting her boring ass friend, Angela Pleasance should have invited her dad, Donald Pleasance, and his frequent director John Carpenter, the Master of Horror. Just because.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> During filming, a camera light fell from the ceiling and hit Angela Pleasence, injuring her head. She narrowly avoided serious injury or brain damage because the shape of her head is completely round and the light bounced off.

I'm sure this is a joke but I choose to believe it is true, and also that when it bounced off it made a bell sound.
