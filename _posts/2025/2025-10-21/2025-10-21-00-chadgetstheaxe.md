<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> At this point this has become a microgenre inside two microgenres (found footage and screenlife): a group of obnoxious as hell influencers go to a supposedly haunted house to investigate, they are basically trying to outprank each other and yeah they fuck around and would you believe what happens next? (hint: it's in the title)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> YES! And they even say "hashtag chadgetstheaxe" (which is the actual title that I can't really write down here for some weird formatting reason I guess)

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> As tradition demands:
![JUST KEEP FILMING](../2025-07-19/livestream.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Okay so the premise is tired as hell by now *but* this movie knows the tone it should go for. It unfortunately doesn't get to the glorious levels of dumbness of ***Deadstream*** (which is a movie I need to rewatch because I *loved* it), but yeah it is very very funny. It's funny how these things go, I've seen movies that had literally (and I mean literally) the same premise that I intensely disliked, but it was because they didn't know they should do what they need to do and A) make everyone dumb as hell and B) make the movie silly and funny. That and if you're going to have the chat constantly on the left side of the screen (or if you're going to alt tab to whatsapp etc) please, make it funny for those of us reading along. This movie did that and it was way better for it.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Look, during the credits there's this compilation of video reactions to the events of the movie that cover basically all of the "content creator" genres, like, from dumb tiktok dances to true crime stuff to people making the equivalent of a vine in 2022, to... I just wish there was more of that because they *nailed* the tone.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>

No trivia, so I'll say the two running jokes on the chat that made me laugh the most were the genz guy who kept asking what any reference was about ("what's Alf?", "what's Baywatch?") and specially and to tie it to our favourite section on our favourite website, the Feet Guy who just posted "show feet" every now and then. And when at some point another person in the chat was like "dude, cut it out" he was like "what can I say, i really like feet". Gloriously stupid.
