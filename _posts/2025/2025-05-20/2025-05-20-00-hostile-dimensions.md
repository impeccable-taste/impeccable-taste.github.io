<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Imagine if you will: an abandoned building that must be the local spot where kids go get drunk, drug addicts go get high, graffiti artists and urban explorers find it extremely appealing. It must reek of piss or worse. Got it? Okay, now imagine an empty room in that building, with a door in the middle of it. I mean "just a door and doorframe", not "a wall with a single door" or anything like that: a door. Now imagine someone opening that door and disappearing when they cross the threshold.<br/> With me so far? Okay, now imagine a couple of filmmakers, Sam and Ash, who want to record a documentary about that spoooooky door and maybe try to find the missing person. Also! They bring the door home because of course they do. Sounds sensible, right? If you find a random door somewhere that seems to open portals to other dimensions of course you'll want that as a conversation piece at home! At least if you're part of an extremely low budget found footage movie, of course!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes! An hour and twenty minutes or so.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Huh, I just realized they don't exactly say it but I was sure they did...

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> What a dumb (laudatory), fun movie and what a letdown of an ending!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Eh I can't be too mad. The movie knows exactly the tone it needs to go for (dumb) and is very ready to laugh at itself without making it annoying. Everything is extremely amateur but at the same time that only makes it charming as hell. It seriously is a pity the film doesn't stick the landing because I was having a great time with it - I guess sometimes it's about the journey there and the interdimensional spooooooky doors that bring us there?<br/>![scary door](scarydoor.gif)<br/>By the way, would you believe this is not the only movie with basically the exact same premise I have in my queue? Yu-yup!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I was going to say we deserved more of That Dog but to be fair he appeared exactly as many times as he should to keep the joke fresh. So instead I'm going to say I could have replaced the suddenly-serious conversations and add more random dimension jumps.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> This film is part two of **The 3/1 Trilogy**, a thematically-linked series of found footage films involving similar cast and crew and shot within the director's flat.

And boy, it shows (nodding in genuine appreciation).
