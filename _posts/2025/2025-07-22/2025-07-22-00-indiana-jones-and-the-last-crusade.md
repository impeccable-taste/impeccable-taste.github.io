<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Indiana Jones! The legend, the man, the archaeologist! His goal this time around? To find the Holy Grail, and also his dad, who has gone missing after being hired to find that very same cup. Will he make it in time? Will he find the Grail? Will he learn anything on the way?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> a bit over two hours<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, but how cool would it be if they did?

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> This is the best movie ever filmed, I will not take any questions at this time.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Whenever I am feeling down or sad this is my happy place. No other movie ever makes me smile as this one, makes me go "hell yeah" as this one, makes me feel a tiny bit better even though things might not be great otherwise.<br/>This is a movie that is important to me for a lot of reasons, but it is also a charming, delightful, sweet and exciting film with virtually no flaws. I once jokingly told a friend (one of the two readers of this, your favourite blog) that I could do a minute-by-minute analysis of ***Last Crusade*** and make it exciting. I mean it, this is an actual threat.<br/>Excellent movie, all time great, only a monster would dislike it.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I'm a huge fan of any moment where the movie clearly shows Henry Jones Sr. is better at everything that Junior might want to do, so of course we could have more "*she talksh in her shleep*" banter going on.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Indiana's birth name was finally revealed in this movie: Henry Jones, Jr. For two movies, he had been addressed as "Indiana" or "Indy." The name "Indiana" came from a dog, in this movie and real life: George Lucas' Alaskan Malamute who lived in the 1970s.
