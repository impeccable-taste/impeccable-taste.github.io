<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Marshall is a dude that looks basically like the M'Lady guy, except with a slightly different fashion sense. He's also a mycologist that has discovered the "Blue Angel", a mushroom that can heal anything if you eat it. And I mean anything! Sounds great, right? Except this goes into full conspiracy territory because one of the largest pharmaceutical companies finds out about the blue angel and... well, if there was a magical thing that would heal all illnesess, they'd be making less money the next quarter, right?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> ten episodes, 20-25 minutes per episode so around three hours and a bit for the whole show<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh yes they do. Not on every episode though.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span><br/>![trippy](trippy.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeah, this was a seriously fun show, I had a great time with it. It can be very funny at times, but the whole thriller-ish part of it is actually really engaging. The voice acting is extremely good, the writting is very witty and hey those two cops are the surprise MVPs of the whole thing. Emphatic recommendation, I had a blast with this. And for once it's a cartoon that doesn't look like ***Family Guy***!<br/>{% include monkey-paw.html %}Oh. Oooh...<br/>uh oh.<br/><br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Goodness gracious that must be one of the most disgusting character styles in the universe. Like, okay, sure, it's not on ***Big Mouth***'s or (shivers, almost pukes) ***Shrek***'s level of nausea inducing crap, but... The characters are all hideous. The worst bit is that all the background art and the general look of the show is very cool, it's just the characters and general choppiness in the animation that makes it look really really bad.<br/>So of course a simple way to improve the show would be to have more scenes featuring the two cops. They're really funny!!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about ~~the IMDb trivia~~ your favourite blog:</span><br/> No funny IMDb idiots saying stuff like "when people eat the mushroom they trip hard, which is a ***common side effect*** of psychedelics", so instead I'll just say that on this blog we openly dislike ***Shrek***, its revolting art direction and the inexplicable nostalgia people have for that green turd. The only redeeming quality is the "my time here is ogre" meme.<br/><br/>Also when I was typing that I realized that another great name for this blog could have been ***Inexplicable Taste***.<br/>I gotta check how much that costs because the more I think about it, the more I like it.
