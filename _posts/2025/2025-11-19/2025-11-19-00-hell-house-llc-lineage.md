<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> ***Hell House LLC*** was a dumb little found footage movie that had a couple of really effective scenes that somehow bought it so much goodwill that it spawned a full series of films. Five, if you include this one. This is kind of a thing considering that uh really, the only thing the original had going for it were those two spooky low budget moments that worked because that's the magic of found footage sometimes. What if I told you the premise of this one is "let's drop the found footage angle after five movies and instead go on a deep dive on the lore and worldbuilding, and also a million scenes featuring that creepy clown that only worked on the first movie?"<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> nah, way over that.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Surprisingly, no. They do say "Lineage", though?

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> It might surprise you that I haven't thought about the previous movies in ages (I didn't even know there was supposed to be a new one, I only found out by accident), so if you expect me to remember names, faces and plot points of the previous ones you're going to be disappointed. Specially if you consider I barely remember what I had for breakfast. *Specially* when you remember that the plot of the previous movies was "people go to haunted hotel, they then die."<br/>Also why the hell would you drop the found footage style in a movie that basically only worked *because* the threadbare budget was helped by that?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> You could say that out of the previous four movies, only two were sorta interesting. The one that might have been the most fun (the fourth one!) *basically dropped the whole thing completely* and went a different direction, even though sure sure it was doing some worldbuilding but it was telling a story. Alas, it's impossible to learn from this.
