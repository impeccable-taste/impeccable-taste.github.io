<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Is there anything more terrifying than getting a text when you are not feeling like replying, but the other person *knows* you've seen it? Well, yes, it could happen to you on your first date, and also instead of being a text it could be someone "airdropping" dumb memes to you or stuff like that, but getting increasingly more threatening. Also your date's a hunk and maybe you weren't prepared for that cause you're gosh just a girl and...<br/>Anyway, yeah, this is a movie about a poor lady trying to have a good date while being terrorized by someone via text. Oh no!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Unfortunately no, it goes over by five minutes and the funny thing is you could lose the last 20 and the movie would be basically the same, except sweeter.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Of course, it is a big plot point for like the first 20 minutes of the movie (then they just switch to texting because I guess the intern wasn't being payed enough to find dumb memes that'd fit the scene)

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> our plucky protagonist here needs to learn about this nice little feature on your phone called "do not disturb" that lets you whitelist some specific numbers, but then again there wouldn't be a movie if that was the case.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> This was a fun little single-room-mystery except for those uh last 20 minutes where it becomes an action movie for no reason at all. It (as usual...) would definitely work better with a tighter runtime, but it makes a good job of giving you some suspicious characters to frown at all the time. In other words,<br/>![well i'm pooped](steamed.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> She should have sent some really bad memes back. Like, bottom of the barrel ones, things like ragefaces and stuff like that. Then the Baddie with a capital B would have died of absolute cringe and you'd also laugh at the awkwardness of the situation. Also that looked like an expensive as fuck restaurant, not sure if the date was going to pay for it but oof, yeah, imagine how different this movie would be if she'd had been treated to some nice kebab instead?

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Loosely inspired by Olivia Sui's experience at a dinner with her partner (executive producer Sam Lerner) and friend (producer Cameron Fuller), where Sui kept receiving random Shrek memes via AirDrop.

Well that'd definitely be way more unsettling. Few things are as repulsive as Shrek, after all...
