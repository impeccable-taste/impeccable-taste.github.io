<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> So apparently we've been lied to and Paris is built on top of some bonkers catacombs that are basically everywhere and are cool and creepy and I mean I'd definitely move there, but yeah. This is a found footage movie that tries to cover the basics of "fuck around and find out", or, why would you touch that, just go back home, you muppet.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> So close, but no.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Hell yeah they do! And anytime they repeat it it sounds even more ominous! Full marks here.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> If I was a character on this movie I would just not let all the cursed horrifying things happen to me, that's all.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Claustrophobic, spooky and specially "why would you even go there"-ish, this is a really fun movie that will definitely make you feel uncomfortable. Really cool ideas, really, really cool stuff happening, extremely good use of the format and genre. Also could they be any more french? I doubt it, and in this case it works well.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> We could use some levity here and there so my suggestion is that at some point someone should pick up a skull and start like, using it as a puppet to talk to the camera, interview the other people in the movie and so on. I bet this wouldn't get tiring at all!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> During one scene, the "Operator Symbol" from the famous web series ***Marble Hornets*** (2009) can be seen in the wall behind the man in the catacombs who instructs Scarlett how to find Papillon.

For those not in the known, aka, people that are not as extremely online as to know about slenderman fanfics, the "operator symbol" is literally a circle with an X sign on top, basically a "don't go there" sign. But my friends at IMDb NEED to find connections between the one thing they hyperfocus on and any other stuff they watch....
