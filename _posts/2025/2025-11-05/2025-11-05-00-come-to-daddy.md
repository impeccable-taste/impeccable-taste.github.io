<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Frodo is a (let's face it) failson living on his allowance that says he's in the music business. That's bullshit because like that meme says, he can't summarize what he does in three words or less. Anyhoo, when the movie starts he's on his way to visit his deadbeat dad who abandoned him and his mom in a luxurious Beverly Hills house about thirty years ago and now lives in Middle O'Nwhere, where half the people are canadian and the other half are kiwis. How will these two strangers (for all purposes) do now they're together for some days?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> just a tiny bit over the limit<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh yeah they do and it sounds *disgusting* in context.

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

![papá rabioso](papa-rabioso.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Okay so let's be very honest: this movie has two very different halves and they'd work as separate movies. Like, up until the halfway point it tells one very specific story, after that, things start to go way more bonkers than you'd expect even after seeing Frodo's horrible haircut and mustache. It works, though - sure the second part is weaker than the extremely strong first part of the movie, but it is still very fun in a dark way, there's not a single character that is remotely intelligent and there's a very, very specific scene near the end that made me laugh out loud and rewind a few times because of how hysterical the delivery was. Fun way to spend an afternoon!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I honestly would wish the movie showed us at any point the "music" Frodo composes. Unfortunately we're left all needy and frustrated here because the movie never goes there.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> At 50:36 you can see Elijah Wood becomes slightly transparent and you can see the window through him.

Extra trivia for you: Frodo is very famously a ghost, which explains why sometimes he's slightly transparent and more importantly why he keeps talking about his good friends, Casper and Slimer.
