<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> There's a ton to unpack here. So Andy and Piper are a stepbro/stepsis dynamic duo that end up having to be adopted by Laura, their foster mom, after Andy's dad dies in an... accident, most likely? Anyway, Laura's weird as hell and she already has another foster child around and that foster child would feel at home in any horror movie, like this one. As things move forward we learn that Laura had a dorter that died in this tragic, tragic accident and she'd do *anything* to (clears throat, looks at the camera, smirks) ***Bring Her Back***...........................<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> about 15 minutes more than that, tsk tsk<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> They do! THEY DO! ... yes, YES!!!!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> {% include wth.html %}<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Okay, this was a pretty disturbing movie. There's this scene around the oh let's say around the 45 minutes mark that *will* get you even though you can see from a thousand miles away that it will end in tears. And trust me, it's disgusting and disturbing and I actually went like "what the FUCK" out loud which is very weird considering there wasn't anyone around. Does this mean this is a great movie? Well, no, it's got a ton of flaws, but it is also very scary and unsettling. So I guess I can say I liked having a bad time with this one!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> what about crappy cardboard 3D glasses for anyone attending, so you can have a bad time AND also need to squint for the duration of the movie?

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> When Andy and Piper first arrive at Laura's house, people are visible walking around outside through the open front door. Since there are no neighour's homes or footpaths near the house these must have been crew members.

Oh, no no no, hahaha, no. Those were ghosts, just like there is clearly a ghost if you watch ***Three Men and a Baby***. Common mistake.
