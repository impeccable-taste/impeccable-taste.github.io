<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Nathan Fillion is this tiny sourthern town's police chief. Life is peachy, except of course he's got a crush on Elizabeth Banks that anyone on earth can see, but she's married to this older (not old, just older) creepy dude. Oh, also, the creepy dude decides to poke this weird slimy thing he finds after a meteorite lands on earth, he gets a megaparasite thing and with that he starts kinda thinging out and being way too hungry for meat. And there's slugs and kinda zombies and oh me oh my.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 95. Almost acceptable, and yet.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No! You know what's the worst thing? They *almost* say it at some point and then they don't. This must be on purpose.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> what a gross, disgustingly fun time we had.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> yeah this one is funny and surprisingly for a early aughts movie, it's aged more than okay. I was surprised by how well the few CGI visual effects look, all things considered and with a couple of big exceptions, the practical stuff is obviously super cool and goopy. And well it's always fun seeing Nathan Fillion play his charmingly nathanfillionesque trademark role, I didn't know he was in the movie and that was a very welcome surprise. Fun stuff.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> of course this was a pretty mainstream movie but I'd kinda want more guts and bits and goop all around. That or, since James Gunn invited his then-wife Pam, maybe we could feature Dwight too.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The original title of the film was ***Wiggle***, but producers requested it be changed to ***Slither*** because it sounded more threatening.

Well, this is bullshit. Sure, ***Slither*** sounds more like the kind of B movie this is trying to homage, but ***Wiggle*** would be an amazingly dumb title. Also, of course,<br/>
