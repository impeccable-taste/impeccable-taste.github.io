<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Belle is a kid who gets a nice video camera as a present. She's wanted one for a while because she'd like to create some youtube channel. Too bad the movie starts with some bodycam footage of a policeman getting inside the family home and finding everyone dead - except for Belle, who is nowhere to be found. What happened between point A and point B of that timeline?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 73 minutes to be exact!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes they do. Not only that, we even get sort of a beta version of the final product because the first time she calls her show "Life with Belle"

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> featuring two kids that are way better actors than way too many adults!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> well that was really tense and very sad too, I suppose it caught me in the right frame of mind to be a bit disturbed and everything. Short, tense, super low budget family film, it doesn't really *do* anything new with the format but I think the kids do such a good job they really make the movie. Also! I loved seeing that the brother and sister *are* good friends, that was cute.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I really didn't like the scene with the worms. Without any more context this sounds very mysterious, huh?

![1/10, Worst horror movie ever](life-of-belle-01.png)

My friend, you created an account just to write this review. If you really think that's the worst horror movie you've ever seen you must be Neo-In-The-Matrix levels of good at dodging bullets/bad movies...
