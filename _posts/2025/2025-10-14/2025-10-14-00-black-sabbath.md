<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This is an anthology movie, which is something I like because in the end it's like watching three short movies in one sitting. In this case, we have:<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeah... the second story is kind of meh compared to the other two, but it still looks amazing. You can basically see most of the first story coming as soon as you hit play. The obvious highlight though is the last segment - good *lord* why would you even touch that!? Fun stuff, sure it feels super tame nowadays but still.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Instead of having Boris Karloff as the host, I would definitely have invited three different people, each of them introducing the story in their own style. So of course that'd be Elvira, The Cryptkeeper and obviously George Corpsegrinder Fisher telling us how the next story is about shooting blood out of

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> During ***The Wurdalak*** segment, Boris Karloff almost never blinks.

It it just me or is this is a bit like saying "the corpse almost never died"...? "Just once or twice, i tell you!"
