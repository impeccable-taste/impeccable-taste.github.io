<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> An extremely handsome dog called Indy and his human friend move to this remote house in (yup) the middle of nowhere. It turns out Indy is the only one who notices that some stuff doesn't feel right: is the house megahaunted? Is it normal that he's clearly seeing stuff and nobody pays attention? Are there g-g-g-ghosts?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah! a tiny bit over 70 actually!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Of course they do. Indy is such a good boy.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span><br/>![i have fond memories of that dog](../2025-07-22/fond-memories.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Surprise, I liked the movie with the dog that happens to be called Indy, like the dog Henry Jones Jr had when he was little. I guess it's canon now that Indy and Indy would go ghost hunting together.<br/>Anyhoo, fun cute movie, very touching at times, some really cool ideas and goodness that dog is not only extremely handsome, he's also a surprisingly great actor. Like, you *believe* the dog's seeing stuff and acting the way a dog would act there. Super cool. I had read that the plot was a bit light but eh, who cares, cute dog.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I found it very funny that for most of the runtime you never really get to see any human face, they are always just slightly out of frame or something is on the way or whatever, after all it's all about the dog's point of view anyway. I think we should go even further with the ***Peanuts*** homage and [anytime a character talked it should sound like the adults on the cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_BU5hR9gXE).

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> After the release of the first trailer, online searches for "*Does the dog die in good boy?*" Spiked.
