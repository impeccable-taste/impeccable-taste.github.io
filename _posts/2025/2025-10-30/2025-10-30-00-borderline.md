<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Jack Nicholson's son is a huge fan of world-famous model/singer/actress Samara Weaving, to the point where he thinks they're a couple, about to marry and that this is definitely real. He's not, though, he's just some stalker with huge mental health issues. Anyhoo, tonight's the night they get married! I'm sure it'll be lovely and the reception will be tasteful.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> about five minutes more<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> no! NO!!!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> So this was on the "horror" category but let's be honest, even though it gets bloody and there's a lot of stabbing, horror it is not. But! Black comedies like this are completely fine for spooktober so it is fine.<br/>So, it's a dumb (really dumb) film, it is at times really funny although most of the time it is "just" charming. It definitely doesn't get super horrific (most of the violent stuff happens off camera, which kind of screams "this was cut to get a lower age rating" to me), but yeah. Even though there's barely any plot going on, I think this would make a very comfortable hangover movie. It is something I won't remember two days from now, mind you.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> there's a character, Penny, that is played by a portuguese woman pretending to be a french lady and honestly i wish she was in every scene of the movie. She had that kind of gremlin on caffeine energy thing and she actually felt deranged. Muse material right there, 10/10 no notes.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> About 47 minutes in, before Paul puts a bandage a Sofia, her wound is visibly close to the center of her forehead. After she wakes up, her wound has moved about an inch to her left.

Imagine, if you will, some nerd pausing the film and pulling out a tape measure while screaming at their other half "NO, DON'T UNPAUSE THAT! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! THIS IS IMPORTANT! PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW!!".
