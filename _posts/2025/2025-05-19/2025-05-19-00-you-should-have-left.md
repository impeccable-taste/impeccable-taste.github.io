<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> In this movie, Kevin Bacon is married to Amanda Seyfried, and he's 27 years older than her. This fact alone would make for a horror movie, but in this case the film addresses this several times, one of them basically as soon as the runtime starts, so I'll just ignore it this one time.<br/>Anyhoo, so she's an actress, in this movie he's not, they have a very young and cute dorter, yadda yadda. Amanda Seyfried's next movie will force her to be out of home for like eight weeks so the family decides to spend the time until then together in one of the world's most beautiful places: *W-Wales*?! Wait WHAT!?<br/>Not just that, but doesn't the house they've airbnb'd look.... *haunted* to you?!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> a tiny bit over the limit<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh yes, and they also say "we should have left" and stuff like that. Very good writing.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> let's be honest, if the house is actually way, way bigger on the inside than on the outside and you have several hidden corridors and stuff like that maybe renting it wasn't such a bad deal after all?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> we-ell. It does the whole "spooky geometry" thing well enough, the three main actors do a great job and the creepy and annoying as hell old man at the shoppe is also very funny. It's just that the movie isn't anything special and you can more or less tell where every single scene is going to end up. Tsk.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> There is a moment where Kevin Bacon is running through the house, opening doors and climbing up and down stairs and stuff like that that would have really been improved by having a cameo by the rest of the Scooby Gang, the Bad Guy Dressed as a Ghost and Benny Hill.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> When Susanna goes to have a bath and she sets her phone on the night stand, she sets it down tilted toward the bed. Before Theo picks up the phone, it is tilted away from the bed.
