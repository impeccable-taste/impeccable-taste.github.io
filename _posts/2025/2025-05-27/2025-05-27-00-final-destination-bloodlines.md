<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> It's another Final Destination movie, if you've seen one before you know what's the deal here. If you haven't, well, just imagine a rube goldberg machine where every single part of the mechanism is made of pointy, dangerous bits. Like, knives, and torches, and angry tigers, etc. So this series is about people basically running headfirst into those.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> No!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> They do say "bloodlines" a lot but not "Final Destination Bloodlines" so I say it doesn't pass the test.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> <br/>![all dumb](finaldestination.png)
<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> one of the funniest, dumbest (and I mean *dumb* and by now you should know here at Impeccable Taste we love our dumb crap) movies I've seen lately, and one that not only fully embraces it but wants you along for the ride. From the cringy guy with piercings that you know will end up being a problem to how immediately the main character starts taking everything super seriously, what a fun movie. And, yeah - **rip Tony Todd**, you were great and your last scene ever was surprisingly touching (specially considering this is a movie about people exploding and all that).<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I think the last scene makes up for most of this movie's issues, so I'd just reiterate this should have been 85 minutes long. It actually feels like a worse movie because of those extra minutes, really.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The way the MRI Machine works in the film is completely unrealistic to life. <span style="font-size: 95%;">While the magnetic forces of MRI Machines can be strong & pull in metallic objects, the way the film portrays the Machine, is far from reality.</span> <span style="font-size: 90%;">For starters, MRI Machines are in a shielded room due to their strong magnetic forces & not an office that anyone (doctors or patients) can walk in & out of. They are also ALWAYS switched on & never turned off.</span> <span style="font-size: 85%;">Even if MRI Machine's were able to be switched on & off, it would take more than a simple keyboard command to activate it.</span> <span style="font-size: 80%;">Also, Computers wouldn't be in the same room as MRI's due to them being affected by the strong magnetic forces.</span> <span style="font-size: 75%;">There's no gauge to increase or decrease the Machines strength either,</span> <span style="font-size: 70%;">nor is there & override feature or a "Do Not Exceed" warning level.</span> <span style="font-size: 65%;">The strong magnetic fields are only strong when in</span> <span style="font-size: 60%;">close proximity to the MRI Machine (10-15ft away).</span> <span style="font-size: 55%;">Most MRI Machines across the US alone,</span> <span style="font-size: 50%;">have a Max Tesla Strength of 3T (3 Tesla),</span> <span style="font-size: 45%;">with very few going to up 7T (7 Tesla) like in the film.</span> <span style="font-size: 40%;">The highest Tesla strength on an MRI Machine can go up to 11T (11 Tesla).</span>
