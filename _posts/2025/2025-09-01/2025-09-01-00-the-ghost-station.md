<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> our heroes: a dude who works at this subway station and an (brace for impact) aspiring journalist. The setting: the subway station. What: some dude being run by the train... but also g-g-g-ghosts with a grudge!? And a mystery? And people who can tell they'll be *next*!? Could you even be so bold as if to say the ghosts have a................... **grudge**??<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes! But for some reason i checked how long till the end many times so eh I guess it felt long.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nah.

<br/><br/><span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> {% include lee-carvallo.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> If you are being really charitable you could argue this is a very loving tribute to ***The Ring*** and ***Ju-On***, considering it follows most of the plot points of the first one (from "this lady is a journalist investigating some weird death" to "there's actually a curse that you can pass on" and of course "there's a very pivotal well in the story, just like the well Sadako of ***The Ring***'s fame crawled out of") and way too many of the second one, although less openly. But, yeah, no, unfortunately in this case this works completely against the movie because you *know* what's going to happen at all points as soon as you realize this is A Loving Homage situation. Too bad.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> It is really weird that this movie features a character right by the beginning and then also by the like halfway mark that only appears there for kinda flavour ("oooh, it's spooky that things are happening to this woman!"), except the character apparently happens to be trans and that means all the jokes about misgendering a person are kind of ready for the taking and the movie doesn't waste a second calling her a crossdresser, a he, "that guy" or whatever. It is some surprisingly hateful and transphobic crap that adds literally nothing to the movie so I honestly don't get why it was there at all.

No IMDb trivia so I will bring you a letterboxd review that made me laugh:
