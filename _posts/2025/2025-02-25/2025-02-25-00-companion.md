<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Iris and her boyfriend Hughie from ***The Boys*** are going to spend the weekend with some friends at this weird sketchy Russian guy's house. Things get a bit complicated when someone dies, but the movie's not exactly about that. Well, sorta.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Almost, really close but no.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes they do! Huzzah!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I don't think I've watched more than two episodes of ***Black Mirror*** but this was, definitely, the best ***Black Mirror*** episode to date - and the funniest.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Here at the Impeccable Taste HQ we are firm believers that if your movie can only be enjoyed if you didn't read any spoilers, your movie wasn't that good to begin with.<br/>With that in mind, I'm glad I went in almost completely blind for this one because it just keeps getting funnier. Some really disturbing "what if technology, but scary" kind of deal going on, even though it is extremely light for a black comedy. Good stuff.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I honestly was a bit curious about the rest of the options on that phone and I might like to know more.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Sophie Thatcher can cry from one eye at a time on command, much to the delight of Drew Hancock.

Well that is a *really* weird thing to admit, Drew Hancock.
