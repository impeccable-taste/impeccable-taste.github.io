<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Lynn is a nurse trying to help Sophie Thatcher, who A) just woke up from a coma B) can't communicate except by blinking and C) might have something really urgent to say about that accident where she fell from a window and who might be to blame.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Ten minutes, but way less if you don't stay for the credits.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

![bed goes up, bed goes down](bedgoesup.gif)

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Fun little short but unfortunately they don't really get to play around with the spooky stuff as much as I expected. The premise is creepy enough, I actually had fun with the movie but yeah I feel they could have made the audience feel way, way more uncomfortable just waiting a tiny bit before running towards the finishing line.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> The most terrifying part of this short was the fact that for some reason Lynn told Mary (Sophie) "blink once to say *no* and twice *to say yes*". She's clearly a psychopath and we do not really dwell on that.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
