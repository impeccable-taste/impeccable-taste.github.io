<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Things are not going great for Samantha lately. She's an ex-addict, her job sucks, she's broken up with her girlfriend (and clearly she's a bit in denial about the whole situation) and is back to living with her mom and because some people would say "well, it'll get better!" she gets raped during a party and gets the worst kind of std, the kind that makes you slowly rot and become a zombie.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> eightysomething, that's good.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Huh, not really.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

![ugh](contracted.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Well that was bleak. On top of, obviously, the way she "contracts" this condition, the fact that she's still supposed to go to work while visibly falling apart and how everyone basically is blaming her without really listening is kind of horrifying. Yeah yeah i've watched movies that do basically the same thing even better and there's a bit of a weird discourse about how she's a "fake lesbian" or "doesn't know what she wants" (bisexual people don't exist) but still - cool movie, very disgusting stuff, still surprisingly tame for what I was kind of expecting to happen. I was going to say something about how ***Thanatomorphose*** goes in a similar direction and themes but honestly it's kind of better that we're settling for "tamer" here. Don't worry, you still get visually harrowing stuff!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> A couple of times you could tell people *should* be reacting more clearly to what they're seeing but I guess it goes with the movie themes anyway. Still, I'd not want her to prepare/serve me food when she's literally rotting, I mean.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> After [character] pukes in the bathroom, he pulls aside the bathtub curtain and discovers a bloody corpse. Although she's dead, her jugular vein is pulsating.
