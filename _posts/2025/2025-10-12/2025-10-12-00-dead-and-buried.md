<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Dan Gillis is the sheriff of this weird little town (in the middle of you know where) that is getting a bit weirder and less picturesque, specially because every day there's at least one horrifying murder happening. Mondays, am I rite? Armed with the help of the town's coroner, they'll try to find out what the hell is going on and specially why does it feel like the dead are being reanimated...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> a tiny bit over the limit.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope. It'd have made a great last line of the movie too.

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> It feels almost bizarre that the only thing I knew about this movie was "hur hur the poster looks similar to the end of evangelion hur hur". This was an total blind watch chosen with Ye Olde Reliable Ritual ("press 'order randomly' on the app, choose the first option, praise Satan") and boy oh boy. Very cool super early 80s (basically ultralate seventies) look and feel, surprisingly effective visual effects and it is clearly going for this pulpy type of short story feel like a ***Twilight Zone*** episode or those charmingly dumb ***EC Comics*** from back when. Really cool stuff, i think it's going directly to the "haha, I need to rewatch this weird crap one day" list.<br/>
