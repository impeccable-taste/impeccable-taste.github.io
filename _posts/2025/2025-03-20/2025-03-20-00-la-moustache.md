<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Please bear with me: Marc's a very annoying french dude who has had a moustache for most of his life. Like, you kinda get the feeling this is one of those "*[hyperfocus area] guys*" kind of guy and all that, considering how important this feels to him. One day out of the blue Mr Moustache asks his wife if he should shave that off, and she basically (but very ominously) goes "you know, my ~~friend~~ husband, *I wouldn't know it was you if you shaved it*"<br/>Left to the reader as an exercise: what is this movie about? Yes, yes, it's about shooting blood out of yo-<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes!!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Goodness gracious they cannot stop talking about that moustache... This is almost ***Uzumaki*** levels of "okay yeah you're really making the joke less funny for everyone and I bet this is not making you any happier so please stop saying the title".

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span><br/>
{% include catstare.html %}

<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Just like Sir Mix-a-lot, I cannot lie: I really like dumb movies that pretend to take themselves really seriously but are kind of, like, on the edge of just winking at the camera if no one is looking at them (but they never do so you just can *feel* they want to). This is definitely one of those movies that also works as a "How it feels to be gaslighted 101" class, in case you are interested in that.<br/>Really, really, really funny in a really uncomfortable "oh dear lord" way. And I really mean it with how uncomfortable it gets at times. Extremely french, although there are no mimes involved.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> look, this is very specific and I know it won't apply to most people reading the blog, but I really am craving some vanilla milkshake and i DO have some vanilla ice-cream in the freezer, so right now I'm a bit disappointed I could have had that while watching this movie, but I didn't. So a single way to improve it would be to give more screentime to my friend Marc when he painstakingly shaves his moustache.<br/>Or, you know, a milkshake.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> During the restaurant scene, there was more wine in the glass the second time Agnes took a drink than the moment before.

I was going to post the "boy i really hope someone was fired for that blunder" gif but uh I gotta say, my friend, please, please, stop looking for *cinema **siiiiiiiins*** and just watch the film. Just let dumb stuff go, you really do not need to care about that kind of thing. That's really not important, I mean this. This is an intervention: please, we care about you and we really couldn't care any less about that kind of "goofs" nobody would even notice. Goodness. Who the fuck cares. Agh!
