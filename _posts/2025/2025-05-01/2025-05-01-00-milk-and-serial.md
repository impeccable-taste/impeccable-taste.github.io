<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Youtube! Pranks! Together! Yes, that alone would be a really horrifying premise (imagine a world where that kind of channel could make money, brrrr haha), but somehow this found footage movie decides to make it even worse! It's this dude's birthday, his name is "Milk" (well it's a nickname) and his friend "Seven" (it's another nickname) is about to praaaank hiiiiiim - but what if something went wrong? No, not that, what if something went actually wrong?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah! Deliciously so, it's just a tiny bit over an hour.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nah, unfortunately.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Somehow I know the events on this movie are basically what all of these channels will eventually go through.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> <br/>![i just think they're neat](neat.gif)<br/>Ahem. This was... good? Okay, sure, it cheats a couple of times with the format (if it is found footage, the camera is what it is. The camera shouldn't move around to give you a better angle unless it's part of the plot a-la [***Mind Body Spirit***]({% post_url 2025/2025-01-12/2025-01-12-00-mind-body-spirit %}), but other than that it is pretty smart with what it's doing, how it's telling the story and the actors are all surprisingly good at playing natural people. It's starting to be kind of a trend that comedians (like the main character on this movie, but, uh, not on this movie) are actually great horror directors, so yeah. Thumbs up.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> no spoilers here but it REALLY should end with "like and hit that bell to subscribe".

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Was filmed with an $800 budget

[laudatory tone] And boy, it shows!
