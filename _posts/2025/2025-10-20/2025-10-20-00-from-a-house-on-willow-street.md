<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This group of evildoers decide to kidnap the daughter of a very wealthy family, the ransom money surely will fix everything! Of course the problem in this case is that the kidnapee is actually **possessed** and things will get **spooky** and **jumpscary**!!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> my copy was exactly that, good job!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No they didn't.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

![gah!](jumpscare.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> This movie looks exactly like the very early "torture porn" movies, and I don't mean "very bloody and gory" but that old dirty industrial look with some colour tints and whatever. This sounds silly but for some reason it was confusing to me. Anyway, yeah, not great, it feels too long by the twenty minute mark (goodness), it's doing nothing interesting with the premise and the fact that it relies so badly on both jumpscares and VIDEO DIARIES (like a crappy fps game) make it a movie i won't recommend. Also, last year's ***Abigail*** showed you can have a ton of fun with a really similar premise if only you don't take yourself too seriously.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> The lead actress on this movie is Sharni Vinson, aka Erin from ***You're Next***. Just let the lady be a badass like on that other movie where she played the ultimate Kevin McCallister.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> In the video recorded flashback, the priests speak of the Codex Vaticanus and mention that the House on Willow Street is a site of evil due to it being the furthest point away from the Vatican where the Codex is kept (illustrating the fact with an apple). This however is geographically incorrect - the geographic antipode from the Vatican is located deep in the South Pacific Ocean, East of both New Zealand and the International Date Line and far away from any landmass that the movie might be set in.
