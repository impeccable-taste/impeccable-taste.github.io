<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> The First World War is about to end with one of those crappy cliffhangers that lets you know of course things are not over, but that's not what the movie is about. The movie, in fact, is about this dude that somehow survived/came back from the dead (spooky, maybe a red flag) fighting on the war, then became one of those uh post-mortem photographers, which is not creepy at all. *Then* one day this cute, plucky, brave girl kind of basically invites him to her town where things will soon go way too spooky, very ghostly, because everyone wants their pic taken with people dying of the spanish flu....<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> no, and it should have been<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> oh yeah, baby!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> what if Casper, but with a hungarian accent, and then just about people being thrown around by invisible forces!?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Eh this could have been better. It's got a strong start and it does one thing 100% right (do not wait to make things spooky if you know you can't do the slowburn-dreadful-tense-tone), it had me with the post mortem photography angle, then it became uh something else and kind of lost me. I was okay with how the movie ends, but it's a pity it wants to switch gears for like 20-30 minutes, geez.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span>more focus on the titular post mortem pictures would be amazing. There's a lot they can do with that premise that would still let them tell virtually the same story!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>

Uhm, well, uh, okay.
