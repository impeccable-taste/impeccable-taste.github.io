<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> A couple get an anonymous gift in the mail: a ventriloquist dummy!<br/>Now, if you're even a bit like me, that'd be your cue to, in this order:
- burn the dummy
- burn the house down
- leave town, change my name
- start a life as a fat, but happy dumb jokester
- *bring vaudeville back*

Which would, all in all, be a COMPLETE SUCCESS compared to the obvious thing that happens here where the wife is killed in a gruesome way and eh. Dummies look weird and spooky.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes! Just barely, but yes.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

![dead silence](dummy.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Okay, yeah, so there was a reason why this is *the* James Wan movie nobody ever talks about. I mean I kinda expected more from Mr Conjuring, but eeeeh. Extremely lame, really bad cgi, even the usual Jameswanisms like "most of the screen is pitch black right now" seem crappy this time around. Dunno, not a movie I'd recommend.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> that dummy has the same problem the Annabelle doll on the conjuringverse has: if you get that home, you deserve anything that happens to you (not victim blaming, just stating facts). I would just replace it with a crappy tickle me elmo thing or whatever and it'd be way creepier.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> (at around 55 mins) When Detective Lipton confronts Jamie at his father's house, the perspiration on the left side of the Detective's face alternates between dry and wet between shots.

My friend, this is an intervention. You need to stop focusing on dumb crap nobody cares about when you're watching movies. Please, I beg you. You have a family that loves you, please stop focusing on the dumbest details in the universe, please.
