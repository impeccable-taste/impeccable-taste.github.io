<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This irish woman buys a house in Myddthl-y-Cwocwere (Wales) and hires a dodgy english occult expert to perform one of those super long crowleish rituals that take like, several absolutely miserable months to summon your guardian angel hoping to make your wish come true. Then, against any common sense, they perform that ritual. What could go wrong!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Ten minutes more than that, tsk.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No. They talk about a "Chamber of a Song" (it must be some occult thing) and definitely about darkness and the void, but not those three words in a sequence.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> ![ye olde booke](book.png)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Just two actors on screen (and boy is one of them a really unlikeable dude), slowly going crazier and having a progressively worse time as the movie goes on, what's not to like? The ritual itself looks painstakingly dreadful, starting with extremely anodyne stuff (basically "fast", "purge", "abstain from sexual stuff" and so on) but getting more and more deranged as the cabin fever thing sets in. It is an incredibly slow burn but I really liked it, it kinda gets under your skin and feels really unsettling and scary. Cool. Maybe this weekend I could start drawing crazy circles and stuff on the floor at home.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> The dude needed to wear a crappy wizard hat, or at least the Wizard's Apprentice mickey mouse hat. And of course nobody should ever comment on it, that'd be seriously cool.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The ritual performed in the movie is the Abramelin Operation, an occult rite attempted by gnostics such as Aleister Crowley. The ritual is meant to obtain "the knowledge and conversation" of the ritualist's guardian angel.

followed by

> Wrongly considered an error, director Liam Gavin chose not to depict actual parts of the ritual and asked artists to change all symbols out of superstition and respect for the process.

This kind of thing always feels really charming and I really liked the trivia for once.
