<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Ah, nothing can really make or break a relationship like a little personal project. In Impeccable Taste's last review ([***A Town Full of Ghosts***]({% post_url 2025/2025-08-19/2025-08-19-00-a-town-full-of-ghosts %})) a couple was trying to restore a ghosttown in the middle of nowhere. Here, though, our dynamic duo knows the key to success is doing things together. For example, killing someone and documenting the whole process.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> A tiny bit more than that.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope, unfortunately.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Well you see, communication is really important because sometimes someone is really (and I mean *really*) into an idea and meanwhile the other person is just playing along...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Cool found footage movie. They *do* answer both the important questions in the genre ("why are you filming" and specially "why do you keep filming?") successfully, and on top of that it is surprisingly disturbing even though you can see some stuff coming from basically minute zero. The two main actors are good in this and the practical effects are *extremely* convicing, which is not something I expected from a very low budget deal. As in, I honestly expected the camera to move away from the first actually graphic scene because I wouldn't have thought that was a prop and not a real person.<br/>Nice and spooky, Jen could be the manic pixie dream girl of this blog I guess.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I would say it's a bit weird that for someone who tries to document literally every second of everything else, by the end there's a *very* significant missing series of scenes that would have been actually cool to see so you could uh see the logistics at play. Still, the rest is fine.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Police showed up to question the filmmakers during the scene when the two lead character are heading into the woods to bury a body.

Awkward, but *potentially hilarious* if our leads were method actors and did not break character!
