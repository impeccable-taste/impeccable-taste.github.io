<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> The year 2010 was a sad one, marked by the tragic death of one Leslie Nielsen in what wikipedia described for a few minutes as "a brief but final battle with his archnemesis Skeletor". Gone too soon if you ask me.<br/>Anyway so this is a reboot of ***The Naked Gun*** series of movies, based on the extremely short lived ***Police Squad!*** TV show that you can watch on youtube or, if you're a big nerd, purchase on dvd years ago like any great person would have done. The never-described-as-chamaleonic Liam Neeson (you may know him from such movies as ***Taken***, ***That Star Wars movie***, or maybe specially his much celebrated role as The List in ***Schindler's List***) takes the baton and decides to join efforts with Pamela Anderson of ***Baywatch: Hawaian Wedding***, ***Barb Wire*** and ***Borat*** fame. Is the result good enough? Did they sell out? Is the movie bad or (worse) woke? Could you film this in 2025?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 85 laff packed minutes<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, *but* there is a joke when you get the title card.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> {% include lenny.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> So, the trailer was cringy as hell and incidentally that's the first scene of the movie, which is a weird choice because on one hand it is the worst scene by far, on the other - from there on the movie only gets funnier and better. Really, really funny stuff, very silly and dumb jokes, double entendres and visual gags. I'm an absolute sucker for "character is dumb as hell but doesn't realize that" and this, just like the original ones, follows that to a T... specially when it comes to our hero and the really, really funny Pamela Anderson completely stealing the show when she's on screen. I didn't realize I missed this kind of movie so much (even after the [***Top Secret!***]({% post_url 2025/2025-04-02/2025-04-02-00-top-secret %}) double feature) but hey, here we are.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> There is a scene with a musical montage that uh *goes places* and the longer it keeps going, the funnier it gets. We had five minutes to spare before getting to the maximum allowed duration so I could have had a minute more of *that*. Not complaining though.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span><br/>
So if you go to the trivia section of this movie and check the "spoilers" subsection, you'll find that some extremely big brained people (think the galaxy brain meme from years ago) has decided to identify what they think are very obvious references to other movies. This, in turn, means that anytime there's uh action on screen, it's clearly a ***Mission: Impossible - Sequel*** reference, for example. This alone would be funny to me because sometimes I'm very easily amused (specially because you *can* tell most of those were written by the same dude). But oh, the cherry on top is that there's **one specific entry** that goes in a tiny bit more of detail. I don't want to spoil any of the jokes and the references for very well versed cinema fans so I'll just take a screenshot after zooming out. Just keep in mind that each of those rectangles is a, uh, movie reference, and try to spot the odd one out:

Yeah. I know, right?
