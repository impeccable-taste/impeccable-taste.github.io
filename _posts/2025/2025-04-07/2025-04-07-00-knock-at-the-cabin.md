<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Don't you hate it when you're trying to enjoy a weekend off with your family, you travel to this remote cabin in the middle of nowhere (which is already a red flag, as usual) and suddenly four weirdos take you and your family hostage and start to talk weird crap about the end of the world? Lately every weekend feels like that, let me tell you, although maybe with less Dave Bautista and the weird kid from the harry potter movies. No, not that one, the weird friend. Yeah.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nnnnope, it is a bit longer than that and, let me tell you, it could have been 90 minutes without losing much.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nah. And they had the perfect opportunity to go "I guess that is why there was a... knock... at the cabin..." and end the movie there.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> This is another M. Night Shyamalan join and just like ***[Trap]({% post_url 2024/2024-10-03/2024-10-03-01-trap %})***<br/> last year, the twist is that it's actually... *good?!*<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Dave Bautista really steals the whole show - I couldn't get enough of his character, by far the best part of a good movie. Very nice shots here and there showing that Shyamalan is actually a good director even if he sometimes is a bit too much into autofellatio, a surprisingly good child actor and, well, let's be honest, a bit of a "wait, there's 20 minutes left?" kind of ending because there's no rose without thorns. I'm not going to think even twice about what the message behind the movie is or what Shyamalan thinks (specially after ***Signs***?) so, death of the author and all: this one was fun and I'm a big fan of this new M. Night "Now Without Twists" Shyamalan guy.
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Suddenly there's a *knock at the cabin* and who else but *JOHN CENA joins the movie*?!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Director M. Night Shyamalan has a cameo in an air fryer infomercial that briefly appears on the TV before the first news report.

M. Night Shyamalan: confirmed air fryer sicko (like yours truly)
