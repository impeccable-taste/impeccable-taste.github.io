<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Supposedly a miracle was caught on camera on this church in Middleofnowherester (south england), but the vatican will not accept it as such without an investigation because the church's reputation could be at stakes. Let's pause for a second while I don't make the obvious joke talking about the vatican, investigations and their reputation in general.<br/><br/>Okay, so.<br/>The vatican sends three guys (Gray, a tech expert/cameraman that is just a work for hire and doesn't really believe in the nazarene; Deacon, a kinda phased out monk that acts as the skeptic/scully of the group but is also the most interested in the investigation and father Mark, the asshole priest that is there just to make you dislike him). The group is apparently very used to finding the obvious scams, so things will clearly be uneventful.
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 89 minutes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope. Also, the movie was released as ***Final Prayer*** in the US of A, but they don't say that either.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>
{% include wth.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> okay, this was way better than I expected. It was never really boring (the real curse of the found footage genre), they were very smart hiding some of the 'tricks'/effects so you wouldn't really see them coming and boy, the last half an hour is extremely tense and that's a *really* bonkers ending that didn't feel like a cheat. Good stuff.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I laughed out loud at how sudden that scene with the asshole kid being punched *hard* in the face so maybe there could have been more of that.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The Irish priest is named Mark Amadin. Throughout the movie, he refuses to believe that there are supernatural forces at work. "Amad√°n" in Irish means "fool".

Also, the other day I learned that "mark" means "worm" in Norwegian, so this dude's destiny ("he sucks") was sealed from the start I guess.
