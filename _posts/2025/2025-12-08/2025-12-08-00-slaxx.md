<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Libby just started working at this clothing store and she chose the worst possible day for this, not just because tomorrow is a special super sale event thing that will force her to work all night long, but also because this is a movie about a pair of jeans that eat people.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah! It knows not to overstay its welcome<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope, and they could just have called the new fancy jeans "SLAXX" and call it a day.

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

![hehehe](slaxx.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeah the movie had basically just the premise going for it, it was extremely cheesy on the way things worked (even though there's a few "behind the scenes" moments during the credits so you see how they made the jeans move around, and surpringly it was a lot more involved than "an intern pulling the jeans with some string"), it was dumb as hell and it was also funny. Sometimes it is about the simple things in life, like seeing a pair of jeans split someone in half.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I'm not going to complain about a movie that made me laugh with how much of an axe it had to grind about working retail, that's for sure, if anything I think it could have gone even further with that and it would have been funnier.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The Super Shaper jeans have the letters "SS" on the back. Throughout the film, when the jeans kill someone, the colour red fills in part of the letters.

This, my friend, is not trivia, you just described something that happens in the movie. It's like saying "in ***Mad Max*** there are some scenes where Max drives a car", or "In the movie ***Alien*** there is an alien in the spaceship and also a cat called Jonesy".
