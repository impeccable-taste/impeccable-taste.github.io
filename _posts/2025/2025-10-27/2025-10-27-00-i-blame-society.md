<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Gillian is an aspiring (all alarms start to go off as soon as that word appears) film director who doesn't seem to be too lucky finding anyone who'd produce her projects. A couple of years ago she got a nice compliment from (her own words) a couple that never gives one, she's now decided to start shooting a documentary about it. The compliment was "you'd make a good serial killer".<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> yeah!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> no and there were a couple of perfect, perfect moments for that.

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> This was hilarious. From the dumb way things start (she is telling her friend about how if she was to become the perfect serial killer, she'd find the worst possible human on earth - specifically his girlfriend, who Gillian calls "Stalin" for privacy purposes) to how they end, the movie is really funny. The darker it goes, the funnier it gets, the fact that most people immediately ignore that she's got a gopro on a headband never gets old. I don't know, this was a really funny look at "documentaries" and filmmaking in general. Cool stuff.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> there's a running joke about how she sets up two cameras (at least) for each scene, and she always clarifies "second angle". This gets progressively funnier as the movie goes, and I think we could have gone even further with her awkwardly pausing the conversation to add another camera to the setup. Alas,

People constantly commenting that she's an unlikeable lead and I don't know, I might be weird but I really liked her. I can fix her.
