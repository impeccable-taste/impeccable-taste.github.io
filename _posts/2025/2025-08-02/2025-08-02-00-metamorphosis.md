<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> So there's this korean catholic priest who is also an exorcist and really messed up the last time he performed one of those, probably because he was on the wrong side of history. Anyway, after such a fuckup his family needs to move (... okay?) and then they're haunted by the demon he never really defeated and it is all a big mess, honestly. Like what the hell, you should know better than this.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> It's a korean movie, it's almost two hours for no reason.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, no they do not.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> proving once again that the easiest way to make your movie suck is to bring up the nazarene and/or the church.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Eh, disappointing. The whole thing about how the demon steal faces blabla is cool in theory, there are some really spooky setpieces around and some inexplicably over the top stuff happening - but the rest is so cheesy and lame. There's a good movie here that never really happened.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> none of this would have happened if instead of a crappy catholic priest the dude was a super cool shaman.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> A spirit mimicing Jung-su during the exorcism scene, his amice his seen while talking to Gang-gu. In the next scene when the light color changes, it is gone.
