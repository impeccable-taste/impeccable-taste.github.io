<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Katie is a film editor who, as these things tend to go in this kind of movie, is not doing great. She keeps getting rejected for jobs, often because she's cut one or two porn movies, her landlord is an asshole, and more importantly she's really struggling for money. That's when she gets contacted out of the blue about a very convenient, very anonymous, very suspicious gig where she's going to earn a ton of money just by editing this crappy student movie that looks suspiciously like a snuff film.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Almost two hours.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yup!

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

![uh oh](freelance.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Well this was a fun thriller, and at no point it felt like a cheat in the way it gave you clues which is somehow a lot to ask for sometimes. Katie is a solid character (it is not too hard to understand why she's going forward with all this descent into darkness fun ride), in no small way thanks to the actress playing her. Also, there's a cat named Pavarotti and that's always great. Of course [***Red Rooms***]({% post_url 2025/2025-01-20/2025-01-20-00-red-rooms %}) had a (if you really squint) similar theme going and was way better than this one, but that's fine. Also, I think it's a safe bet to say you should not, at any point, get involved with snuff movies.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Katie was asked to cut, edit and add some background music to the films she is editing. It would have been cool if she would go for some ***Batman 66*** style for this, what with the **POW** and **ZAP!** and so on.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
