<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> these three extremely australian kids decide to film a documentary about a railway museum that is supposedly haunted by a serial killer's ghost, boooo are you scared!!? This is for a class assignment, of course, but even knowing how important that class must be, the museum guide tells them they cannot film at night. Of course they proceed to break in and well, good thing they never stopped recording or we wouldn't know what happened after that!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Half that, actually.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> nope! And they had the perfect opportunity right at the beginning, too!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> my favourite bit was when the movie would let you know when something spooky was about to happen because they'd drop this sick drone music, which of course means someone must have felt there was this 'something' missing.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Eeeeh this wasn't good, and this time not even the ultralow budget charm thing could save it. Somehow a very short movie feels long as hell, it drags and drags and it's not like they're trying to set up the characters or anything like that - I guess they thought that'd give it a more dreadful, spooky pacing. Well, I'm afraid that didn't work, friends! Inexplicably this is a movie that keepds being brought up if you search the internet looking for found footage recomendations, which once again confirms you should only trust your favourite blog.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Cut the duration by half, only be cheeky hinting at (instead of showing) stuff on the first few minutes, let the tension ramp up but then don't be afraid of showing more stuff as the movie goes, you know. The usual stuff that makes this genre fun!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Shot on location at the National Railway Museum of Port Adelaide, South Australia.

Incidentally, I turned on the auto generated subtitles a couple of times because I was like "boy, those sure are some thick accents". Well, I guess not even the evil powers behind youtube were able to decypher the accents a couple of times so I don't feel that bad.
