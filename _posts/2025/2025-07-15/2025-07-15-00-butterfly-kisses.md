<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This is a movie about two kids who were trying to film a documentary about Peeping Tom, a local urban legend where this creep will follow you everywhere if you somehow manage to stare down a tunnel for an hour at midnight without blinking (yeah, try doing that). It is also a movie about an absolute loser (and I mean it when I call him loser) finding the tapes those kids recorded and trying to make a documentary about them and how they disappeared without a trace, but also about how he wants to get very rich. It is *also* a movie about a group of professional filmakers making a documentary about that loser, which happens to be the film you're watching when you sit down and hit play. Would you believe this convoluted, inceptionish setup actually pays off?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> A minute over the mark because we cannot have nice things.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh boy, do they! And it is such a bizarre disgusting concept too!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span><br/>![whatever you do, don't blink](butterfly-kisses.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> So it's not a huge secret that [I like found footage movies]({% link tags/found-footage/index.html %}), specially since they tend to be extremely [low budget]({% link tags/lowbudgetcore/index.html %}) and that kinda makes me happy when it works. It's a format that lets you do really weird, really cool stuff if you just happen to have a good idea or something to say. This is a movie about obsession, but it is also a huge love letter to the genre. It is a surprisingly clever movie that is even more rewarding if you like crap like this because it uses all the tropes and then turns them around. Excellent film, surprisingly funny, surprisingly tense. Probably the third best movie in this genre I've watched, after ***Noroi*** and of course the flawless ***Lake Mungo***.<br/>What I mean is, it's good shit, really.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> there's this scene where the loser gets invited to a radio program to promote his movie, and basically every single phone call they get is just there to laugh at him or insult him. I wouldn't mind five extra minutes of that because it just keeps getting funnier when you see him basically wanting to disappear, but also trying super hard to become The Hulk with all that rage inside.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb ~~trivia~~ reviews:</span>

Is there a german word for feeling nostalgic about something you've never really experienced? Because I would watch that movie a million times every week if it existed.
