<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Somehow someone managed to send a cameraman to the distant past of 192X and they sent back an actual documentary of the trials and tribulations surrounding the filming of ***Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror***<br/>This, in practise, means that we get to see how John Malkovich of ***Being John Malkovich*** fame and Impeccable Taste's husbando, Willem Dafoe, get to play themselves, back when they were filming ***Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror***. I think that was the gist of it.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Just two minutes over the ideal duration!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Well, no, but they do talk about it. Does that count? On one hand, no it does not, on the other, hur hur *he said count*.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> <br/>![shadow of the vampire](shadowofthevampire.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Let's be honest, this movie was basically made for me. I'm a super basic bitch and love all things nosferatu in general, I want to sleep in a coffin just like him, really liked the Eggers remake, etc, etc. Add to the mix Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich and literally everyone else in the cast (Cary Elwes? Suzy Izzard?? Udo Kier?? John W- wait, no John Waters? ouch) and you get a love letter to the original, tailor made for dumb assholes like me who know the movie by heart.<br/>Also, there's a lot of laffs and somehow it still manages to be scary at times, so, you know.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> One of those movies that would benefit from being even gayer than they already are if anything because it'd go from subtext to text and we all love that. That's all, no extra notes.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The first movie Nicolas Cage produced.

Good *lord*, when you think there's no way a movie could be any better.
