<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Remember those SCARY CLOWN videos from almost a decade ago? And the way any news site knew they could just give that some visibility if they didn't have enough content for the day, just by reporting anything any dumbass said they had seen one day while coming back home after drinking and all that? So what if I told you that the dumbest, and I mean the dumbest couple in the universe decided to film a documentary about them? And what if I told you things of course don't go the way they expect!?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah, about 80 minutes or so.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yeah, it is the name of the in-movie documentary and they say it a few times.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> <br/>![send in the clowns](clownfactory.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Oof, this was a *really* bad movie. I mean, sure, yeah, of course just from the premise I kinda new what I was in for. I know. I should know better. Still, this was a pretty craptacular motion picture, I tell you hwat.<br/>Lowcost found footage is one of those genres where the actors are very... hit or miss, more often than not just miss. There were a few scenes where the couple we're following was okay, I suppose, but in general they were *bad* and the script wasn't helping at all. And yeah that script smelled of the First Draft Experience, stuff like "the writer just learned about this word so for some reason everyone keeps using it", blabla.<br/>The biggest issue though: with this genre you are kind of prepared to have nothing happen for the majority of the runtime, then you get to The Really Spooky Stuff when things Go Crazy by the end of the movie - well, about that... go back to the one sentence review, yeah.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> In the classical "let's interview random people on the street about the topic of our documentary" segment of the movie the lady in our power couple decides to ask a black lady if she's heard about "Clown Lives Matter" as a phenomenon. I think we can just drop that scene.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>

Inexplicably, there's no trivia entry going "this was very obviously recorded in the director's house, their hometown and the little forest about a mile away" but I bet this is the case.
