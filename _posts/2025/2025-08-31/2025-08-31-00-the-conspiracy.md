<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> I'd please ask you to look up to the pic I chose for this review. Yup, this is a fake documentary about people going deep, deep down the rabbit hole and finding out things they shouldn't know about. Or just people mistakenly thinking that correlation is the same as causation etc.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> yes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> YES!

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> This was surprisingly fun? I honestly thought it was going to be, well, just another found footage movie but it actually was very very engaging, and not just in the rubbernecking "people do believe this" kind of sense. There are many little cool things to like in this movie, not just seeing how two canadian dudes slowly buy into every single conspiracy theory in the universe and how that goes oh so wrong. A really fun watch and it doesn't overstay its welcome. I really liked how the framing device (the fake documentary that shows the found footage) is so blatantly written to make you go "wait, are *They* the ones releasing this??" (read "*They*" in your most conspirational tone of voice, or replace that word with your favourite NWO group).<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I really liked the first conspiracy nut dude and unfortunately he's very quickly out of the movie. I wish there was more of him, maybe show him having lunch out, talking with the pigeons, looking at a sunset while smoking, etc.
