<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Our friend Diana wakes up in a really metal way: trapped in some bunker after a nuclear holocaust, surrounded by corpses, probably being the only survivor. Cool stuff. Unfortunately she's not metal enough and gets lost and passes out, but every cloud has a silver lining because thanks to that she meets the other character in this short movie, General Gore. Unfortunately though General Gore is kind of an absolute asshole and it's not clear if they will manage to get out of that bunker safely, what with all the radiation and mutant monsters and stuff. Will their newfound friendship be enough to help? (Spoilers: no)<br/><br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 50 minutes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yup.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review [Let's make this interactive, please read the next sentence aloud, without pausing for breath]:</span><br/>This film is both trying to do some serious/semiserious/slightly sarcastic social commentary and also features a dude farting another guy into existence, after which the newborn guy just blows himself up with a grenade.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> The foley on this movie is *atrociously bad*. Like, it's extremely jarring and way too loud and out of sync. This is a very very very low budget movie so I am not going to say "sounds like free sound assets they found online" because A) they most likely are and B) good for them for using them... but yeah it's a bit like "my first audio editing gig" way too often. Like the woman drinks some water and there's some very cartoony GLUPS GLUPS GLUPS sound, etc. I'm kinda surprised when she was sleeping they didn't play the "snore mimimimi snore mimimimi" cartoony sound...

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The film has been described as Samuel Beckett and Jean-Paul Sartre meet John Carpenter and David Cronenberg.

The writer/director's grandma is VERY proud of him and just googled four names before typing this trivia.
