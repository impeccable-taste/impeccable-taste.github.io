<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> It's Chief Hawk's last week on the job and of course that means something really bad is going to happen. In this specific case, a body washes up on a lake, in a canoe, and we're being *really* generous with the definition of "body" here because it's missing a lot of stuff and also maybe has spares of some other bits and bobs, dunno, it's disgusting. Our guy finds out that these seem to be the (polite cough) remains of a doctor that was doing some experiments in a cabin in the middle of you guess where and it's going to get goopy and weird and sorta tentacle-ish (no tentacles in this movie but there's a certain threat of them).<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> A couple of minutes over the line.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yup!

<span class="reviewsection">First thing I thought of:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> So uh there's plenty of neat stuff when this movie starts, the premise feels a lot like a cool short weird horror story (or, dare I say, a cool horror rpg one-shot). The characters are paper thin but that's fine, the effects are surprisingly competent for what must have been a really low budget, and uh, suddenly nothing happens for half the movie and then boom it's over. The really odd thing is that there are like, at least twenty different movies almost about to be filmed here, with plot threads that exist for the best of ten seconds sometimes and then are never even remotely brought up again. Dunno. Really weird pacing, too bad because I was sure I was going to like it a lot more.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I kept being reminded of ***The Void***, another Canadian horror movie with cosmic horror stuff thrown in, and uhm, yeah maybe this movie should be a bit more like ***The Void***, then it'd be way better.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Slash, guitarist from Guns'N Roses executive produced this film and contributed to the score. The cast also includes Alex Lifeson, guitarist for the retired Canadian band Rush.

And Mr Lifeson plays a character conveniently named exactly like him, who is only in the movie via skype and plays a conspiracy uh enthusiast kind of guy. Okay so the last bit is just for flavour here but, hey, good for Slash for giving a friend an easy paycheck that he must have recorded in about twenty minutes. Maybe it was a Cameo?
