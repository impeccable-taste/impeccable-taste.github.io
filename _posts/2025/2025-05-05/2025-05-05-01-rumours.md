<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> The G7 (which you may know as the public face of the Illuminati, or at least what/who They want you to think They really are, although we all know that's not Them, bec<sub><sup>ause They</sup></sub>-) are having some meeting or whatever where they talk about Rich People stuff, and also about how to Deliver Messages and Politics and it's all so annoying but that's not what the movie is about. What the movie *is* about: world leaders are suddenly lost in the woods, and I mean *lost* in the woods, and things stop making any sense and also there might be a conspiracy afoot AND there's a big crappy polystyrene brain and... Yeah this is a hard to summarize movie. I guess it's a metaphor for something.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Ah, no.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh, yes!

<span class="reviewsection">One ~~sentence~~ image review:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> this is a hilarious horror comedy that does the best possible thing: it starts pretending to be a serious movie about uh politics and important stuff, then it very quickly (and I mean *very* quickly) gets dumber and dumber by the second. Amazing cast all around, a lot of laffs to be had here.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> there's this joke... in the movie, Charles Dance is the president of the United States and he speaks with an extremely thick british accent. At some point someone asks him about that, he is almost about to reply and the scene is cut and you never find out why. I'm very very very very and I mean *very, really* easy to laugh but that one caught me completely off guard. I had to rewind and watch again a couple of times because that joke just landed perfectly, like, chefkiss.<br/>I wish there was a similar joke with the Italian dude and his Muzzy English level because, let's be honest, he deserved that kind of spotlight.

Well I guess this clearly shows that some people have some really terrible opinions about movies and are physically unable to have fun. Meanwhile other people can laff and laff because they were gifted with what you could call an *Impeccable Taste dot com*.<br/>(Oooooh that's the name of the blog!)
