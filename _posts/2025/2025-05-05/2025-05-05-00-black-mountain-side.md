<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Okay, stop me if you know this one: this movie follows a group of people stranded in an outpost/research station in the frozen arctic. They are all sporting some bushy beards, they all drink and smoke like sailors, they're completely isolated from the rest of the world. More importantly and this might be what solves the puzzle for you: their job there involves an excavation, and they just unearthed something that seems alien, like it doesn't belong there at all. Well, what do you think? Yup, you guessed it - it's none other than John Carpenter's masterpiece and the best horror movie ever, ***John Carpenter's The Thi-*** wait *WHAAAAT*!?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> No, 99 minutes total. It's a very very slow paced movie too.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope. Tsk.

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Uhm, yeah, this was (ahem) slightly worse than ***John Carpenter's The Thing***, unfortunately. There was some cool stuff here and there and if you've been reading this blog for a while you know I adore my low budget crap, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to save it. It must be cool to go spend some days in the snow with your friends and basically do a loving homage to ***John Carpenter's The Thing***, but with more cosmic horror and canadian accents.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> instead of setting the movie in the arctic, set it in antarctica because it's cooler than Canada. Also, maybe add a <sub><sup>(John Carpenter's The)</sup></sub> Thing or two, and uhm, also, maybe contact and get some notes from the Master of Horror himself, John Carpenter. Of ***John Carpenter's The Prince of Darkness*** fame, of course.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The cast and crew actually lived in the cabins where the film is shot. They had no internet connection or cell service.

Incidentally just last week there was a complete blackout in all of spain and I think those few hours without an internet connection were enough to let me know I'd die in the first few minutes of any of these movies.
