<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This movie follows a journalist that wants to find out what happened to her friend, who was writing a book about the MK ULTRA stuff you only see brought up by weirdos. So we're dealing with mind/state altering drugs, and conspiracies, and some spoooooooky shadow entities that haunt you if you do those, and a Hunter S. Thompson lookalike, and jumpscares, so many jumpscares!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah, a few minutes less!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, and worse than that, they kinda tease us with it. Like, at some point they go like "and how did they call it?" "well, it's the name of the *chapter*" but they won't say "banshee" even once. This should earn a penalty or something.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> {% include winners.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> I'm a bit disappointed, maybe because this movie came recommended by some people I trust (never again). I guess I wanted to like it more than it'd let me, I don't know: I actually thought the beginning was pretty solid and I had fun when the Hunter S. Thompson dude appeared, but it feels like it both didn't know what to do with the premise and then it went nowhere by the end. Missed opportunity, I guess.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> For once I think this is the kind of movie that'd benefit from actually showing instead of hinting at, and when I say "show" I mean "for more than two frames". By the end it got a bit silly, how it avoided showing us anything other than bad makeup.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> MK Ultra Is real. "Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra) was an illegal human experimentation program designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and intended to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used during interrogations to weaken people and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture. It began in 1953 and was halted in 1973."
