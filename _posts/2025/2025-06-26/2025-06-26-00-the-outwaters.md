<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This is a found footage movie so of course our main guy is an aspiring filmaker that just cannot turn his camera off. In this case he's friends with this woman who is an aspiring singer that wants to film a music video for her song. Yes, two "aspiring" kind of people with a cast of four, this is a horror movie alright. Anyway, so it's four people going to the Mojave Desert, recording stuff, having a scary time during the night and then one hour in things get spoOOooOOooOOoky!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Inexplicably, no.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Another "no" that will make you go "but why not?"

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I know I use this one a lot but trust me, this movie deserves it:<br/>{% include wth.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> So uh that was... weird. Okay, the very very negative: this movie is about an hour longer than it should be. The first half is extremely slow (and I don't mind slow, but when there's a reason for it) and once we get to the fireworks factory it has like, at least 40 minutes of pitch black darkness where you only *hear* stuff and screams and also sometimes there's a flashlight on for a second but it never points where you want to see.<br/>And, surprisingly, I still liked this? It is bold as hell, there's time loop-ish shenanigans, it is disgusting and gory once it gets to that point of the movie, it really makes you wonder what the hell is going on, there are scenes from early on that you might have catch and then you feel kinda smart (in between feeling dumb because you also are like "but seriously, what's happening?")... and boy oh boy that certainly was a way to end your movie. I can imagine this is the kind of movie people HATE but I don't know, I guess I was in the mood for weird crap.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> So Impeccable Taste's most devoted fans might have noticed by now that, well, I'm very dumb. When the movie started the singer character for some reason ("oh, she's blonde, pale and also sings?") reminded me of Amalie Bruun of ***Myrkur*** fame, and if anything I'm true to my muses so I think this movie would definitely be like a million times better if it was about her recording some new video for her next album. Also if she said she liked the blog and then immediately said the movie title. Yeah. I'm very easy to please.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The cast and crew were swarmed by bees while filming. Some of the incident remains in the movie.
