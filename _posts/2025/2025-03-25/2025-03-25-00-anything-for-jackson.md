<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This very old couple are grieving the death of their very young grandson, whose name (you guessed it!) was ~~Jason~~ Jackson. They are a very polite couple that on the other hand are ready to resort to maybe more controversial measures to bring the kid back.<br/>Incidentally, they very recently joined a cult *and* the guy, who is a maternity doctor, is treating this very, very pregnant lady... so, maybe...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope, almost ten minutes more.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh yes they do.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span><br/>![the DEVIL](hankdevil.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> This was delightfully charming, it keeps dancing between dark comedy and horror and gets some extra points because it is committed to both (I specially got a kick of how long they keep bringing back a very specific joke because, trust me, I'm very dumb). Of course it could go way more into the horrific side of what's happening but eh. There's something really sweet about how consistently nice they try to portray the grandpas, I don't know. Cool stuff and the vfx (which apparently were practical?) are very fun too! And it has creepy hidden ghosts? Nice!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I found out a moment ago, the pregnant lady was played by someone called Konstantina Mantelos. I have a very severe face-blindness problem so the moment I saw her I thought that was Melissanthi Mahut, aka Kassandra from ***AC: Odyssey***... so yeah, of course a simple way to improve the movie would be to have the lady speak with a heavy greek accent and constantly go "... *mal√°ka*" at everything. Thank you.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> In the *Book of Beur*, writer Keith Cooper added a fun line in Latin for anyone trying to read the book in the movie. "*Tibi gratias ago tibi, quia propinqua est quaeritis*" Which translates to "*Thank you for looking so closely*"

See, *this* is some fun trivia I liked to learn about and I will promptly forget ten minutes from now. Not (nerd voice) "there's one scene where the glass of water is slightly less to the right on the table, boy I really hope someone got fired for that blunder hur hur".
