<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This is a visual novel that I bought basically the day it was released, I played for like half an hour, recommended it to a few friends and then I promptly left it installed on my steam deck but never got around to play it. I'm super good with my finances.<br/>Anyway: so the game is set in the 80s in a certain district of Tokyo where they have some urban legends going around. Would you believe there might be some truth behind them? And would you believe things will get weird and kinda cursed!?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> nope, but it's not extremely long for a visual novel (around ten hours?)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> They say the subtitle ("***The Seven Mysteries of Honjo***") a lot, but at no point anyone says "boy it's like you have some sort of... ***paranormasight***!!!!"

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> You're cursed - cursed to LIKE this game!!!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Yeah this was a good game. I really liked the art style, I found the story and characters to be pretty cool. They didn't do a ton of weird stuff with the genre but it was still fun. Actually, I think I like that at some points you were able to guess some of the plot points but unlike other games like ***Phoenix Wright*** or ***Danganronpa*** you weren't punished for being able to read between lines and you actually felt a bit smart, even.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> it is the nature of the beast and the more you learn about the plot, the less spoooooooky it feels until it is just a kinda spooky investigation. Not a huge deal, but to be honest in that sense the game went from "hey this is kinda scary" to "well this is a nice story" and things like ***Ringu*** prove you can keep the investigation super scary the whole time. So, yeah, taht.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ Seven Mysteries:</span>

No trivia on IMDb this time around so uh well, I can link the way too detailed [tvtropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSevenMysteries) in case you want to know how in episode 4 of this really obscure anime you've never heard about a character makes a reference in passing to the seven mysteries thing. For example, Yakuza 3 does this and was one of the first places where I learned about this kind of crap. Anyway,
