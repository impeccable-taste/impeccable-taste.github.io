<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes, and thank you.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope, I mean, there's no dialogue at all so of course there's not a random character just going "begotten deez nuts" or something.

<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> So uh I mean, there's definitely a story being told by this film and I'm sure if you are very smart you can tell what it is about, but to most of us mortals this is basically a movie that looks exactly like what black metal wants to sound like. I've watched this uhm motion picture quite a few times so please do not think I'm saying "it's bad, friends" - not at all. Just really unsettling.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> replace all background sound with a song by Lesley **GORE**, *Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows*:

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The film was originally intended to be a theatrical stage production with interpretive dancing and a live orchestra. This idea was scrapped when E. Elias Mehrige realized the production would cost about $200,000.

I mean this might have been a bit too much, the thin line separating "this is really cool because i'm mentally 12 years old" from "okay you're a tryhard" so good thing they didn't go for that!
