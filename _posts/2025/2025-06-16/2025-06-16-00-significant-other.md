<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Boom, a meteorite hits this forest! Also, the next day this apparently loving couple goes trekking in exactly that forest! And also maybe, just maybe, they are not the most loving couple considering that they're ready to jump at each other's throat! And also, maybe they will do that eventually? Oh and there's a spooky deer, and probably shapeshifting aliens?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, and I think they could have easily squeezed it in.

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> This was a fun take on cosmic horror and a very tightly paced movie. I was able to feel very very smart because I identified a couple of red herrings, I also didn't see a few twists coming at all, which was very fun. Impeccable Taste HQ's official opinion about plot twists still stands (if your movie completely depends on them, maybe it's not that good), but it was cool to be caught so off guard. Neat little sci-fi/horror movie and as someone with sadbrains it was surprisingly effective/funny when *that* became a plot point in a very specific way. Cool stuff!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> By the beginning of the movie I couldn't help thinking about ***Annihilation*** and ***Nicolas Cage's Color Out of Space*** and the weird animals/flora on those movies, but unfortunately we don't really *go there* in any way. I think having some of that weirdness (cosmic horror is also often called weird horror, after all?) would help, and the good bit is, you can just have it happen in the background of an otherwise normal scene and that would be enough!

> Completely full of plot holes [...] Maika Monroe's character eats meat after they point out she's ordering the vegetarian menu before

My friend, I know this might be impossible to understand if you've got the palate of a five year old, but sometimes people feel like eating some veggies or fruit even if their mom's not around to scold them.

Also the movie tells you exactly why she might want to eat that.
