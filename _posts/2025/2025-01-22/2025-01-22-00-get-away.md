<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Four english tourists decide the best way to spend their holidays is to go to this swedish island in the middle of, uh I guess some very remote part of Sweden. Apparently their custom is to commemorate this historic tragedy from around 200 years ago when four Englishmen brought ruin to the island, and they were promptly killed and eaten.<br/>I have no concept of object permanence so I wouldn't be able to see anything wrong with all this.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes, less than an hour and a half.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No. I mean, they say the words in order but not in any way that should count, just as part of other sentences. I have to be a very strict judge sometimes.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Sweden just can't take a break.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Mixed bag. It's actually very funny and the last stretch gets really, really funny and bonkers, but it's also one of those "well that came out from nowhere" kind of deals. Too little too late? On the other hand I'm all for really dumb humour so...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I do not like when movies overexplain their "lore" (ugh) but I was really curious about that weird mask with the very very dumb face. I mean, look:

![just look at it](get-away-mask.png)

What's with that mask? Haha like, what the hell, I want to know a lot more about that guy!<br/>
So I suppose you could improve the movie by focusing more on that and/or making those a pair of giant googly eyes.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The swedes speak english among each other, and they speak both poor swedish as well as poor english.

I love me some catty clearly written by a swede trivia, although yeah, it was kind of funny how quickly everyone stopped speaking swedish. For good reason, I guess, considering most of the cast is finnish!
