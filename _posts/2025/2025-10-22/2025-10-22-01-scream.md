<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> You're home alone, maybe waiting for your crush to come back home so you two can watch a movie, when suddenly the phone rings and some weirdo's asking you about your favourite horror movie. Dumbly, very drewbarrimorishly, you don't immediately answer "***John Carpenter's The Thing (1982)***, the best horror movie ever", which seals your fate.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> No, but of course ***John Carpenter's The Thing*** is just two minutes shorter than this one so for once let's ignore this.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh yes.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> please allow me to repeat myself

![don't you blame the movies](../2025-04-16/dontyoublamethemovies.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> One of the good things about movies is that sometimes you're feeling down, but just watching *that* film you like will cheer you up a little, or at least make things more bearable for a while. ***Scream*** definitely qualifies as one of these movies. It's amazing how a film that so openly wants to make fun of horror tropes, that is so *resolute* about deconstructing and burying the slasher film once and for all manages to be one of the best examples of the genre, if not the best one. It is dated, sure (I mean, a plot point is that a character is arrested because they, like the masked killer, has a cellphone. *It's nineteenninetysix, babeh*), but also extremely stylish, fun and so, so funny without treating the audience like an idiot. The kind of gentle wink that goes "yeah we both like this, huh?". What a fun, fun movie.<br/>

{% include tellyouwhattodo.html %}<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> This is very subjective but the initial scene is probably the most brutal moment in the whole series, and yes, I've watched all the movies in the series AND the tv show that nobody watched. It is kind of a pity that it never goes *there* again because ooh boy was that something that made young me feel like maybe buying this movie ticket was a bad idea...

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The high school scenes were to be shot at Santa Rosa High School in California. However, very close to the shooting date, the school board read the script and denied the film to be shot there due to the violent nature, as they had been under the impression the film was a comedy, and production was moved to Healdsburg, California. As payback, director Wes Craven put in the end credits under the "Special Thanks" section, "NO THANKS WHATSOEVER TO THE SANTA ROSA CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT GOVERNING BOARD."

Hell yeah, fuck Santa Rosa High School.
