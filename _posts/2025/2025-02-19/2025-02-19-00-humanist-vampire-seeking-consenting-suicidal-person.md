<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Okay, so Sasha is a vampire but she doesn't want to hurt people to feed herself, which makes her kind ofa huge NEET in this world. Incidentally, Paul is a really sad dude that honestly can't see things getting any better and is thinking about a very final solution to all the things going on in his life. Could there somehow be a solution to both of their problems?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> According to what I watched it is *exactly* 90 minutes, so i will nod and clap.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> I mean, no. It would of course have improved the movie but they didn't find a way to naturally bring it up.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> What if ***Let the Right One In***, but also ***Amelie***?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> That was a cute, fun, enjoyable movie, big thumbs up time here at the Impeccable Taste HQ. I had a great time with this film, it was charming and funny and I spent half of the time smiling like an idiot. I guess I can be a softie sometimes, it's not all about being black metal and all that. Funny to think that I've recently-ish watched two Quebecoise horror movies released in 2023 (the other one being [Red Rooms]({% post_url 2025/2025-01-20/2025-01-20-00-red-rooms %})) and they couldn't be any more different in tone.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Just invite Lazslo from ***What We Do in the Shadows*** and let him do his thing.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> **Rico the Clown** is a real clown that they hired but didn't tell him it was a vampire movie until after the fact.

"*Until after the fact*". I have so many questions.
