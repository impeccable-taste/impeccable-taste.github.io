<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Let's make this review interactive and play a little game, I'll let you know how much you are scoring by the end of this premise section. The idea is, tell me at what point during this summary you'd go "nope, i'm out" and just leave the movie if this was happening to you.<br/>So!<br/>A couple with some relationship problems decides to start a youtube channel where they will document their little project! they're going to buy a fake ghosttown in the middle of nowhere (we're told it's 3 hours away from civilization basically) and their plan is to restore it and make it a tourist attraction! Also half of the couple (the husband) is *way* more into the idea that the other (the wife), specially considering they've literally sold everything and put all of their savings into this! Also, there's a sort of haunted-house-maze thing in the town! And in case you haven't left yet........<br/>there's no internet reception other than super expensive satellite, boooo!<br/>yeah you win the sooner you realized this was a horror movie, you're very smart.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> just a bit over an hour actually<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> They.. they do!? THEY DO! Huzzah!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> the title is a lie, though, there's just one ghost and she needs an axe to do her ghostly thing?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Uuuuuuuh I'm sure you can guess this wasn't a good movie in any way, if anything it was mercifully short but oh dear, that wasn't great. Like from minute one you can tell basically everything that's going to happen (which isn't necessarily a problem if the movie is fun, mind you), it constantly breaks some found footage """rules""" (why is there spooooooky music, unless you've already edited your footage?), it suddenly jumps like three steps forward to get things going... But yeah the worst bit is that I expected a movie about an old timey far west ghosttown *full of ghosts* and eeeeh uhm. No.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> The title shouldn't be a figure of speech. Like, there should be so, so many ghosts in this town that it'd make you feel agoraphobic. The town equivalent to the thouse on previous review (and very fun movie) [***Anything for Jackson***]({% post_url 2025/2025-03-25/2025-03-25-00-anything-for-jackson %}).

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The characters say that there is no electricity, but in the beginning when they are showing the Ghost Town, you can clearly see wires and a fan running in the old church. You can also see power lines in the background when he is talking to the investor. UPDATE: He actually says, "electricity is solar".

I love the update because it means my friend here either got some email OR rewatched the movie and went "oh. Oooooooh, they DO say that". Either version's very funny. Also, it reminded me of the evergreen funny tweet:
