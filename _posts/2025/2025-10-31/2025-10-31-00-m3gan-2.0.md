<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> ***M3GAN*** was an extremely campy, incredibly tongue in cheek horror comedy from a couple of years ago that showed, in Jaime Lannister's words, the things someone'd do for love. For example cut a bully's ear or run like a rabid dog, or tiktokdance or be a killer robot in general, whatever. Fast forward to this sequel, where after *another* killer robot appears, M3GAN needs to be brought back... but this time she's on the side of the good guys!? Ruh roh!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Two really self indulgent hours<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> I mean the constantly say "M3GAN" (you gotta enunciate that 3 clearly) but they don't drop "2.0" so I guess nope.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Okay yeah this is not trying to be horror anymore and any violence is conspicuously off screen... apparently that also happened in the original movie but I only watched the unrated cut which did have closeups of M3GAN doing gory stuff to people. So this is not that, that's for sure. What it is though is a really dumb/funny movie with more catty remarks by an asshole doll with a comically large head doing like martial arts on henchmen and whatever and a plot that gets stupidly convoluted for no real reason AND - look, I am going to just go ahead and say it: it's not a great movie, but I had a really really fun time and I want to watch it again at some point. You can *feel* M3GAN rolling her eyes as she says her lines, goodness gracious.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Go ham, give us more costume changes, make her comment on those, make her even more asshole-ish, dunno. And make the next one a completely different genre once again, of course!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> It's unclear exactly which year the movie is set in. The first film film (released in 2022/23) was set in 2025 as seen by dates on security cameras etc (although the actual midsummer sunset time for Seattle is later than depicted), and Cady goes from age 8 to age 9 at some point between February and May. At the start of the second film (released in 2025) Cady is 12, theoretically meaning the year is 2028. Cady gives the events since the previous film as being the last two years (not three) but she could be an unreliable narrator. But then [redacted] is killed on screen and his memorial at the AI conference says "1968-2025" when there is no way it can still be in 2025 unless the dates of M3GAN 1 are being retconned. A fan theory is that the memorial date was tampered with in-universe, by someone who wanted to make a statement that the time M3GAN's files were stolen was when [redacted] was doomed.
