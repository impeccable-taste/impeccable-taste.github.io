<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This girl who's studying to become a nurse is visiting her grandparents. She hasn't visited for a few years now, her parents and little brother are not arriving until a couple of days after and she's feeling a bit awkward about it because when she was little she used to have nightmares about this room by the end of the corridor which was always locked. When she gets there, although her grandparents clearly love her and are really concerned about her happiness, you can tell something's off.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> One minute under the mark! Hell yeah!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope, unfortunately no.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>
{% include wth.html %}<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Reading the premise you might think this is going to be a jaypeg horror adaptation of the Perrault/Super Grimm Bros' ***Bluebeard*** way ("you can open any door but this one") but trust me, you won't guess where this goes from here. And where it goes after *that*.<br/>Well that was a bleak and disturbing movie, but also uncomfortably funny very often. If anything my complaint is that for most of the movie the main character is the most passive "oh no, what's going on" person in the universe, but I guess at some point your brain just turns itself off and you stop reacting to stuff. Other than that...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> there's a moment (and excuse the minimal spoiler) where a character is run down by a car and they use the fakest, crappiest dummy in existence to show you the results of the accident. Like, you see the doll fly away and bounce on the floor a couple of times... give me more of that kind of thing! More movies should go that route instead of trying to look super serious with visual effects.
