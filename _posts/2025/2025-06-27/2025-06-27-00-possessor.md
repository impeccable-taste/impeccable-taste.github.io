<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> It's the not so distant future and everything looks extremely disappointing! We do not have flying cars yet, what we *do* have is some weird tech/process that lets you kind of insert your consciousness in somebody else's uh body, and control it! The obvious users of this technology? Assassins hired by this shady corporation that will "possess" somebody so the cops can't find out who was behind the crime! But what if, on her very own One Last Job our main character was losing control over the puppet?<br/>This is a movie written and directed by Cronenberg Jr. You might him from Impeccable Taste's review of [***Infinity Pool***]({% post_url 2024/2024-10-26/2024-10-26-01-infinity-pool %}), or maybe because he is the son of some canadian dude, I don't know.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> about 15 minutes more than that.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nah.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Sean Bean is in this movie and you will never guess what happens to his character.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeah, this was excellent. It nails the really depressing and *dehumanizing* tone when showing you that how dumb and anodine this "future" is. It is bleak as hell and goodness it gets brutal on a couple of scenes in particular. There's also a surprising amount of nudity and cocks on screen and of course (go back to the initial point about the tone) there's an extreme detachment when they're on screen which I'm sure is not some kind of subtext. Cool stuff, great visuals and cinematography, really effective and again, so, so bleak.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I kinda laughed when the first nude scene happened because, honestly, I wasn't expecting it at all and it was treated in such a clinical way. So, uh, more random nudity just for the sake of it, yeah.

Hell yeah, long live the new flesh!!

Wait, why would you write that and *then* give the movie the lowest score IMDb allows? I'm getting mixed signals here.
