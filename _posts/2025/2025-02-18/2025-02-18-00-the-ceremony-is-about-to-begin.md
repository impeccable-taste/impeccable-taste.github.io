<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Keith gets the opportunity of a lifetime (if you film documentaries for a living) when the leader of this group/probably cult agrees to be interviewed! Maybe he will find out what happened with his ex-girlfriend?<br/>Alternatively you could say the premise of this movie is that Keith is a nerd that couldn't get over this old girlfriend and she must have disliked him so much, she joined a cult. Being a very normal person, Keith starts to film a documentary about said cult, and what would you know, the current leader invites him to the ranch!<br/> This is a movie that advertises itself as a mix of ***Creep*** and ***The Sacrament*** so you can expect both a weird cult AND awkward interviews!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> It's about an hour.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes they do, to much fanfare.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I spent a while trying to find out if this was a student project because I didn't want to be too rude to the "*we are clearly about five friends filming this during a couple of weekends*" type of film, but apparently it's not so...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Look, [I like low budget stuff]({% link tags/lowbudgetcore/index.html %}) and I'm ready to forgive **a lot** when a movie is charming or has something going for it.<br/>This got to embarrassing levels of "I really, *really* liked ***Creep*** and ***Creep 2*** but I don't get why those movies were fun", to the point where they're clearly repeating some scenes. Or maybe it's an homage, I don't know.<br/>Yeah, it's just an hour long but you're better off skipping this one, friends.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> for like half of the movie I was constantly thinking about that "*the funeral is about to begin... sir*" quote from ***Phantasm*** which is also featured on ***Hearse*** by allegedly apolitical black metal band *Marduk*. So I think this movie would be way better if it featured a really creepy tall dude, floating chrome balls and I guess some dude tryharding in corpse paint.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ ... movie?!</span><br/>A way too generous letterboxd review says the last bit of this movie was filmed in a Egyptian Themed escape room. I know that's bound to be a joke about how low budget everything is, but being a firm believer in "never let the truth get in the way of a good story", I'm going to accept this as a fact.
