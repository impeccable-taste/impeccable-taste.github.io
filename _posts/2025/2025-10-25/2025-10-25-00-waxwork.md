<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> A group of late eighties teens (that is, a group of late twenties/early thirties "teens") are invited to this private waxwork! They're currently hosting an exhibition about the "most evil beings" and would you believe the crappy displays turn a bit more realistic than you expect as soon as you get too close?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> about five minutes more than that<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh yes they do!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

![el cordon de terciopelo...](velvet.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Yeah this is a very dumb, cheesy, funny horror comedy from exactly when it was filmed. It's basically an excuse to throw down several little scenes with horror monsters and friends with the thinnest excuse for a plot... but who cares, it was dumb and very aware of what it was trying to do, so good job.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I loved anytime you could tell a wax figure was actually just a dude in a costume trying his hardest not to breathe and i want more of that.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Writer and Director Anthony Hickox wrote the screenplay in only three days.

And it shows! (laudatory)
