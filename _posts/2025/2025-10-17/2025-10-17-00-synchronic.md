<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Steve and Dennis are paramedics and best friends! Like us! Unlike us, lately they're being called to help some people who are getting *really* bad side effects after consuming some designer drug, the titular ***Synchronic***. At the same time, Steve finds out he's got terminal brain cancer, Dennis' teen dorter goes missing after (you guessed it) trying that drug. Steve tries it too and finds out the drug lets you time travel - so he's decided to use the little time he has to try and find Dennis' dorter...<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Unfortunately no.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Fortunately yes.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> So this is the third movie in a loosely (and I mean *very* loosely) connected "trilogy" of sidequels along with ***Resolution*** and [***The Endless***]({% post_url 2025/2025-05-15/2025-05-15-00-the-endless %}). They all feature some time shenanigans and soft sci-fi elements, the other two are more openly trying to be funny too, this one feels a bit more serious. Honestly I thought it was going to be a bit scarier but only because of the whole spooktober thing. They clearly have some budget this time around and it shows, the story is really cool, the two leads are *good* and really feel like good friends going through some really bad time... Honestly, it's a fine movie. So basically the only problem I had was "i thought it was going to be pure horror but no", so I guess I can't complain.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Oh well yeah sure, there's a dog in this movie and (to save you the doesthedogdiedotcom frantic googling), he does not die but he doesn't get a happy ending. That's a bummer and i didn't need it.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> In subsequent shots, the dog's leash changes distance on the floor when Steve reaches for it from the couch.

Is there a word in german for that feeling of sadness and existencial dread when you realize someone else's life is so empty of everything that they not only are paying attention to this kind of thing, they think it is important to share it with the world and *probably* feel smug about noticing?
