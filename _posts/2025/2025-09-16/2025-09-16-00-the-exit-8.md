<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> So basically there's this guy who wants to get out of the train station, but he kinda gets trapped on his way to exit 8. Just looping corridors repeating the same layout again and again... *Or do they*? No! sometimes there are "anomalies", and uh according to this big poster by the entrance when that happens he should turn back and go the way he came and<br/>So.<br/>Would you believe this movie is based on one of those video games basically made for streamers so they can interact with the audience and be amusingly scared at what happens?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> A bit over that. The weird thing is that I beat the game in less time than that back in the day, so, uhm.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Oh, do they!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Sometimes a movie can be super fun with no dialogue or story, this is not the case here!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> This could have been super dumb but fun (as usual, those two are very often twin concepts), and it actually really works when it's just being a sorta silent movie where the guy just walks like "huh?" and "eeeh?" and "hm." while looking at the background and weird stuff happens. Inexplicably, they decided to add some extremely unnecessary backstory about... a... baby? and some wife the dude left? or... something like that? What? What the hell was that for? Too bad because when it works, it works.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> There are these... well, way too few "loops" where the movie lets you try and see if you can spot any anomaly before the character does. I really don't understand how you film this and don't do that literally every single time, really. I guess the answer is "well, just play the game again" but you know, whatever.
