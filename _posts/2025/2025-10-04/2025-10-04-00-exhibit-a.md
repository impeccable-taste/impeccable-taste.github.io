<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Judith just got a camera (and let me tell you, this is kind of a big deal if you're a teen in 2007 because we weren't carrying a computer full of gadgets everywhere in our pockets back then) which she uses both to kind of document her unrequited love for her neighbour and more importantly, random little moments at home with her family. They might be about to move soon, they want to get a house near the beach if his goofball of a dad gets promoted at work - which looks like a sure thing. Except she (and by extension we, the audience) starts to notice something seems to be off with her dad - and we only realize because she sometimes will focus the camera on him by accident. But everything's okay!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yup, 85 tight minutes.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nah, unfortunately.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span><br/>![very troste](milhouse-troste.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Well, that was... not exactly what I was expecting, but this is not exactly a bad thing. It is horror, but more in the sense that you can feel the dread building up and up. No jumpscares, just seeing how each member of the family has some very deep secrets and how things go to hell as the dad loses one screw too many. They are pretty clever about how you are seeing things unfolding, and why Judith keeps trying to document everything. It ends on a really horrific note. And then the movie gives you a last big kick on the face right before going to credits, in case you were laffing too much.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I honestly felt really really bad about both the mom and the poor megacloseted dorter, but I think what I'd really like would be more yorkshire slang being thrown around left and right. Keep that runtime where it is.
