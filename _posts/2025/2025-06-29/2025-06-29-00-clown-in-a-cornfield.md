<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This girl and her incredibly lame dad move to Nowhere's Middlettown, a tiny town where nothing happens except when people start dying at the hands of a clown... in a cornfield!? Also uh i guess she befriends the Bad Kids in town and whatever.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> about five minutes over the perfect duration.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, no they don't. Trust me, there were a ton of opportunities to go like "watch out guys, there's a clown in a cornfield!" but alas.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Boy, that clown's name was Frendo but he was not friendly at all I tell you hwat!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Extremely dumb horror comedy, surprisingly funny because at no point it takes itself seriously (thank goodness). Most of the cast is extremely dislikable in that very 80s slasher kind of way that lets you go "well, whatever, just die I guess" when the inevitable happens, blabla. A ton of red herrings (I'll admit I was completely sure things were going to go a different way), lots of laffs, lots of clowntastic goodness. I don't even mind clowns one way or another, and still!<br/>Also, I don't think it was a coincidence that Kevin Durand's character looks so much like the dumbest, most divorced man on earth, Elon Musk.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I know this will sound really dumb but I was kinda into the dumb fake Frendo videos the horrible teens were recording and I wish we had seen a bit more of that.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> A bow saw can't cut off a head.

That's some extremely specific trivia right there, chief.
