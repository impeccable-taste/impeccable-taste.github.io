<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> We follow this journalist and rich faildaughter who basically messed up big time recently, writing some article where she accused someone of stuff, and then that person turned out to be innocent. No one will hire her now so of course she turns to the nuclear alternative: starting a true crime/mystery podcast. Except I guess everyone's heard everything about the Night Stalker and the Roswell stuff and Elvis and whatever, so she's kinda stuck with writer's block... until she receives an email that kinda puts her on the trail of this big investigation involving people being seriously affected by some sort of ventablack bricks, and art collectors and oh boy oh my!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> a tiny bit over the limit, too bad<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> no, they don't

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> <br/>![monoliiiiith](monolith.gif)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> this is a really slow burn but that works on its favour. Some great decisions make for a tense, really uncomfortable at times watch. Stuff like having our very rich protagonist be the only person we actually see in the movie, or how all action happens on her extremely huge house in Little Middleofnowhereville (South Australia). Really cool stuff, really cool take on Weird/Cosmic horror, I really like how open ended a lot of stuff is. And boy do they nail the "this is a pretentious podcast about something completely irrelevant that we're going to pretend is super important" tone, trust me.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> i honestly wanted a few more testimonials/interviews, but if we can't have that at least it'd have been funny if we got to listen to some crappy ads recorded by our host. Like, food delivery crap, or maybe some boner pills etc etc, the sky is the limit.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> This movie is a one-hander which means it has a cast of just one actor.

I mean, there are more actors (they just don't appear on screen), but in any case... "one-hander" sounds *really*... questionable. Very close to The Stranger and stuff like that, I'm sure.
