<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> People get more and more obsessive about spirals, like, grotesquely so.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Still less than 25 minutes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Relentlessly.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> so uuuuuuuh i guess they spent all the animation budget on the first episode and SOMEHOW they decided to hurry things up even more, completely messing the pacing...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> that was quite the drop in quality, geez.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> maybe this will be controversial but I'd be fine if it took a long long while to make the show, but it looked like that first episode I liked so much. Thank you.

*Did you know* Junji Ito is a really nice, charming guy?
