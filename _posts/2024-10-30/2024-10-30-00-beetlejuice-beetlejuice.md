<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Is it even possible for Tim Burton to film an okay movie after literally two decades of really bad ones? And yes I consider ***Sleepy Hollow*** his last tolerable one (***Big Fish*** is an exception and I liked it a lot, it's still 20+ years old). Let's find out!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope, and there are more than one musical numbers so chances are we could have had a shorter runtime.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yep, and by that I mean they say Beetlejuice's name twice and stop, so this gets full marks.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> The spanish word for "*expanded polystyrene*" is "*corchopán*", and this movie is full of that, puppets, goo/jelly and practical effects.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Surprisingly funny but it's also like, five different short movies strewn together for some reason. There's also way too much Known Pedo and Sex Offender Jeffrey Jones here even if he's not really in the movie.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> During an appearance on the *Happy, Sad, Confused* podcast, Winona Ryder admitted that she considered Beetlejuice and Lydia's "*endgame*" and advocated for them getting together

But... but they do. Hasn't Winona watched the cartoon??? They go on adventures together all the time!
