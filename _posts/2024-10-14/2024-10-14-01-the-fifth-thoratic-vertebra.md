<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Chronicling the travels and adventures of a moldy (and I mean *moldy*) mattress, how that mold is kind of achieving conscience by eating vertebras and how *extremely crust punk* korean people are to sleep on top of that garbage.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> An hour.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Uh no.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>
{% include wth.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> The mushroomy visual bits were cool, the uh metaphore thing it was going for was okay, but maybe it could have benefited from being shorter and maybe I was expecting a ton more of disgusting glibs and blobs. I cannot recommend though.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Let's make this movie about cheese, people eating cheese and the Inventor of Cheese instead.
