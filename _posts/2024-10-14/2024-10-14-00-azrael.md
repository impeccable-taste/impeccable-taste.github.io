<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> A title card right before the movie explains it's been a while since The Rapture<sup>TM</sup> happened and some people now think talking... as the ***Pet Shop Boys*** put it, *itsa, itsa, it's a Sin*.<br/>Soooo you get Samara Weaving, crazy cultist people, no dialogue and some weird stuff in the forest.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yup, proving *once again* you can introduce the viewer to a whole setting and tell a story in less than an hour and a half.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, but i mean, the idea is nobody is talking? This time it shouldn't count.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> {% include nod.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Oh it did have some flaws but *who the hell cares*????<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> More of that ending, please and thank you.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span> I think *every single negative review* by the bigbrains at IMDB goes "*but __I__ don't get it??? what was that!*" which is kind of astonishing.
