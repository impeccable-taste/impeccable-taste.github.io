<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> The day of her 50th birthday, Demi Moore is fired from her job because apparently she looks too old. She then finds out about the titular substance, which offers you the chance to become an improved (perfect, even) version of yourself. What could go wrong!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> good lord, no, it's two hours and a half long.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> boy, *do they*!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I made this with an appreciative tone, imagine I'm nodding like that lumberjack guy gif.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> This was both hilarious -in a really *really* dark way- and it really, uh, goes places. What a bonkers last half an hour, man. It's baby's first body horror movie but still, a really fun ride.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> The premise "Demi Moore looks too old now she's 50" is ridiculous enough as it is, but it is made even worse by the fact that she's *over ten years older than that*. So my suggestion is that Dennis Quaid's character should do retching noises whenever he talked with her, make comments like "oh god I cannot even look at you" and so on. Go full ham.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> Coralie Fargeat has cited David Cronenberg's ***The Fly*** as an influence on this film

You don't say.
