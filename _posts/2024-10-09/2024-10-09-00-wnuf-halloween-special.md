<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Supposedly a tape recording of a halloween special from 87 where things don't go as you'd expect, full of commercial pauses and that cheesy local area network flavour. horror comedy. There's even a "*we have the warrens at home*" couple, except they're The Bergers (I kept hearing "The Burgers")<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> yup! phew!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yeah, anytime they go to a break and trust me they do that all the time.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I hope real american tv doesn't cut to ads as often as this thing does because ooh boy, that got tiring very quickly!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> It's fun because of how purposefully low cost everything looks, but ultimately it's a pretty pointless thing<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I'm sure this didn't need to go to commercials as often as it did. ***Ghostwatch*** was way more effective without doing that all the time!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> The alien ships featured the commercial for the Saturday morning sci-fi show are a model of the D7 Klingon Battle Cruiser from Star Trek: The Original Series (1966)
