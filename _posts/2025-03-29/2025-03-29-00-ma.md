<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Octavia Spencer plays Ma, who is basically this really annoying lady/dude that is around and kinda keeps inviting themselves to your stuff even though everyone can tell you never meant to invite them, but of course you won't say anything because that'd be rude, cringe and uncomfortable for everyone involved. So yeah she's extremely lonely and decides it's a great idea to invite horrible teenagers to her home so they can party but at the same time keep her company and this is a horror movie so as you can guess things will get messy.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope, just by a few minutes. Sometimes I think "should I change this to 100 minutes?" but it's the principle of it, damnit.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> ah yes they do, often.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> eh, this could have been better. There are some really gruesome moments that make you go "ooooof, that must have hurt" and so on but all in all it's a bit too cartoony when it shouldn't and way too dumb when it wants to be serious. Too bad.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Based on an experience Adam Devine (Workaholics) had in high school. Devine told Theo Von (on his "This Past Weekend" podcast) that he is friends Scotty Landes who developed the story into a screenplay. Devine and his friends had met a woman who would buy them beer and make them drink a couple at her apartment while telling them to call her "mom." At one point Devine became so intoxicated he had to lay down, and the woman put him in a bed. He then heard the woman telling her real 13-year-old daughter to get into bed with Devine. Devines friends picked him up and took him out of the apartment before anything else could happen.
