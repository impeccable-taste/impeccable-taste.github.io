<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> The day after a not-that-great (to put it mildly) office party, this couple go for a run in the woods while constantly, obnoxiously having arguments. Little do they know they're going to jump into one of those time loops movies have told me about while very very hungover...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah, although honestly it often feels like more.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope. I guess it's the name of the pond.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Further proof that exercising, and specially running, is a bad idea.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Okay so little known fact about me (very well known fact about me): i'm a total sucker for time travel/time loops/let's just have fun with time in general in my movies, which already makes me want to like the movie. The tone is all over the place, though, at some points the comedy lands perfectly, very often it is just annoying. The arguments get very grating specially since they basically go from 0 to 10 in the first five minutes and they never go down... This was originally a short and it clearly shows the writer had a few more ideas, but maybe not almost 90 minutes worth of them.<br/>
It's still fun in an ultra low budget just-two-actors kind of way, and it still goes pretty dark at times. So...<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> i say instead of going for the obvious kind of conflict, team up with several alternate yous and dunno, maybe start an a cappella group instead!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Dana Berger and Max Woertendyke [the two stars] first met each other in the summer of 2013 while playing a tumultuous couple in Jay Stull's play THE CAPABLES at The Gym at Judson in NYC.

Ah, okay. So by the time they filmed this it had been 9 years of constant arguing - this kinda puts things in perspective...
