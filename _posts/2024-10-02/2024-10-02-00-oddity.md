<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> What do you get if you mix weird twins, blind people, one-eyed people, irish people, creepy houses in the middle of nowhere and a shop of cursed antiques? Because this movie has all of that, but it's not about that.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope but it is close enough.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> I don't think so.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> this was pretty good, it uh went places I didn't expect *at all* AND it has an amazing last shot.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Thumbs up, recommended, watch it and enjoy.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> 

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> One of the items in Darcy's room of haunted objects is a wind up cymbal-banging monkey toy. This could be a reference to Stephen King's haunted toy from his short story, The Monkey, from his book Skeleton Crew.
