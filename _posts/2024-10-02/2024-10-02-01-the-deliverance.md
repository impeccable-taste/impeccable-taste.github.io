<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Rihanna's body double, Glenn Close and that Stranger Things kid move to a new house and the basement's not great.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> good *lord*, no, it wasn't and it actually felt like it was a million hours long.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> yes, at least it has this.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Not even Surprisingly-Horny-Glenn-Close (imagine that shiba inu going *bonk* and sending her to horny jail) saves this satanic panic thing.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> the... first half is sort of okay I guess. Also they say the movie title. Uh.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> please do not be mean to Satan, our lord and master. It's not his fault you bought a megahaunted house.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> After the birthday party, Ebony Jackson is wearing Shante's "birthday girl" tiara. Between several cuts, it switches from normal to reversed and back to normal again
