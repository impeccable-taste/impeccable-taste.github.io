<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> A very lonely hairdresser might like her clients' hair a bit too much. Also her best friend/crush (not necessarily reciprocal to either of those) is getting married.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nnnnope.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> sorta but not in a *look directly at the camera and nod* way so it counts but shouldn't count. I'll tag both options.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> on the bright side, hair loss might not be that bad.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> It's fun.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> It's based on a short film and i think we would have had enough with like 45 minutes, maybe an hour. It'd be a lot punchier!

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB ~~trivia~~ user reviews:</span>
A lot of people on the user reviews are asking what happens with the bodies after the fact. This is a really interesting question if you are a nerd that can't just watch movies and need Lucy Lawless to tell you it was a wizard.
