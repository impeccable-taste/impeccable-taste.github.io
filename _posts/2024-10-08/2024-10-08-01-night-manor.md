<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> It's one of the games included on ***UFO 50***, this one is an ***Uninvited***/***Shadowgate*** thing where you wake up in a dorky dark house and need to find a way out.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Around that but I think there are more endings and there's definitely stuff I didn't do. I might give it another go!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> ***Shadowgate*** scared the *hell* out of me when I was little, this game actually startled me a couple of times and was actually very fun to play.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Just like the rest of ***UFO 50***, this is amazing.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDB trivia~~ steam reviews:</span>
> Honestly, it's an anti-nostalgia collection where the games seemed designed to accentuate the worse features of titles from the 80s often combined with sado-core design features from modern games

I think anti-nostalgia-sado-core would be a pretty sweet music genre I'd definitely be into.<br/>"*Yeah i'm super into ansc, my favourite band is __Urkel's Whip__*"<br/>
"*oh you too? I love __A.S.S__! (__Alf's Shameful Secret__)*"
