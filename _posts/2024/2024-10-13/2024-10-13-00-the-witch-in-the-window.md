<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> One of the most divorced dads ever brings his kid to this remote house in the village so they can repair and flip it. But would you believe the ghost of the previous owner might still be around... *in the window*!?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Thankfully, yes.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> sorta, but not really.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> This could have been a really good one (things like the dad/kid relationship were treated super well) but unfortunately it ended up being a pretty crappy movie that doesn't know what it wants to be, do or say, ouch!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> The first time I saw the titular witch I was like "okay *here we go*!" so it gets that.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> Maybe if they went full Mike Flanagan about this, including hiring Kate Siegel...?

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about ~~the IMDb trivia~~ how I watched this movie:</span><br/>
Remember the ***Magic Eye*** thing where you need to go all crosseyed to see a bad 3d render? There are a couple of scenes where they point the camera directly at one of those Magic Eye things, and OF COURSE I paused the movie to check what was hidden there. And OF COURSE I didn't get it right at all and I had to check the IMDb trivia because what the hell.
