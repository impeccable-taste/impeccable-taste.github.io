<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Somehow, ~~Palpatine has returned~~ spirals are still everywhere.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Sure, still twentysomething minutes.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> To be honest they say it so often it's kinda ruining the joke.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> the animation is juuuust slightly better than the horrendous second episode, but somehow ~~Palpatine has returned~~ the pacing has gotten even worse!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> i will never forget the hilariously terrible last 30 seconds when they go "*oh uhm er we forgot to resolve this so here you go!*"<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> it is okay to cut a plotline sometimes even if it was very present in the original manga.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> The title series is the japanese word for spiral

[*record scratch*] wait, ***what!?***
