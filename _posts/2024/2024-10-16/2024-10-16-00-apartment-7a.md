<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> I went in completely blind so I didn't know that this was a prequel to ***Rosemary's Baby*** set just a few months before the original. This time the main character is a dancer who would do almost anything for a chance to be famous! I hope ***Wishmaster***'s Djinn doesn't hear this hur hur hur!<br/>Also featuring a ton of delightfully creepy old neighbours.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Actually you know what, I think they don't but I'm sure you can read it several times. Does it count? Decisions, decisions... YES!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> yeah i'm never having kids.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> I actually liked this one a lot and I think I will rewatch the original just because of this.<br/>Recently I also had basically the same experience with ***Immaculate***, a movie that I had only read **bad** things about and then I enjoyed a lot, and not just for the crazy last half hour.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> It would be seriously cool to give us more of the neighbours because, seriously, I could listen to them ramble about stuff for ninety minutes.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> At and hour and one minute into the movie, William Shakespeare's name is spelled Shakeapeare on the Hamlet poster on the wall

this is clearly wrong because we all know The Bard's name was **Chespirito**.
