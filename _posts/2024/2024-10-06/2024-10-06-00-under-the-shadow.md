<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Set in Iran in the early eighties very shortly after the revolution, the movie is about a mom, her kid and something haunting their house right before they can move out of Tehran. A couple of friends recommended me this saying they were reminded of both ***The Babadook*** and ***A Girl Walks Alone at Night***.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> That was probably the less subtle subtext I've seen in a while.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> It wasn't bad but I would not recommend it like that, to be honest.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> the mom had this illegal VHS deck around and we see some of the movies she's managed to find. Show the kid watching more random movies recorded from US TV there, like, dunno, maybe she's a huge fan of ***BMX Bandits*** and you can tell things are a bit wrong because she's now watching ***Videodrome*** constantly. See? Foreshadowing.

> I don't know where to begin. This is probably my first Iranian film, and reading all these really rave
reviews made me believe I'm on to a good experience. Far from it, this was by far the worst movie I've
watched in the last 6 months. I feel a certain perverse pleasure now that I watched this awful movie that,
there are other countries out there that produce equally horrid content outside of India.

What a rollercoaster. I'm also very curious about what was that movie six months ago, tbh.
