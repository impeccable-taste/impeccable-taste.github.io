<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> It's the anniversary of this little girl's disappearance and everyone is very weird in this neighbourhood. Also one of the narrators is a cat called Olivia who completely steals the show.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> nope, it's 300 and something pages and i'm not *Number “Johnny” Five* of ***Short Circuit*** fame.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Almost, but nope.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> I liked the cat narrator but the rest didn't live up to the hype Richard Bachman had created on the cover blurb.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Meh. Maybe do not make your book depend on one specific twist nailing the landing.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> add a raccoon friend for the cat.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ Goodreads reviews:</span><br/>
I like when you check user reviews and you see a lot of them are basically saying the same thing, except the score is either 0 or 10.
