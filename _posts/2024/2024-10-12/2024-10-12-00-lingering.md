<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> After her mom's death, a korean lady has to take care of her half-sister. She decides to for some reason go to this weird middle-of-nowhere hotel where a friend of her dead mom lives and everyone is weird.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nope, just by ten minutes but *alas*.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> I didn't catch it. Maybe? I'm going to say "no".

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> "*quien mucho aparca poco aprieta*‚Äù, which i guess is spanish for "*biting off more than you can chew*" because this movie is sometimes pretty creepy but it also wants to do *so many things* it ends up just being a mess.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Eeeh.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> you can safely cut at least one character from the movie and lose literally nothing.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> Korean Title: "*Hotel Lake*", or, in Korean, "*Hotel Leikeu*"

This means two things: they *did* say that several times during the movie so I guess it addds a point to that category and also korean is an easier language than I thought.
