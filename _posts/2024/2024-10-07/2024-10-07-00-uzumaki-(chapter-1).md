<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> First episode of the anime adaptation of that Junji Ito manga where people on this little town are a bit *too* into spirals.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Less than 25 minutes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Constantly!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> gorgeous visuals but the pacing is a bit rushed, it jumps from one little scene to the next and it would really benefit from giving it a bit more of time to breathe.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> if the pacing was slightly better it would get full marks.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> everyone gets super sweaty on this show, I say let's give each character a handkerchief.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
