<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> A collection of essays by queer writers (some well known, others I hadn't heard of before) about horror, otherness (percieved or not), queerness and how closely they are often intertwined.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Nah, but it's not a super long one.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No. They use the crossroads metaphor in the second part of the title several times, though.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> This was a very very nice read, the essays cover a ton of very different but very personal topics and some of them are really touching.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Recommended if you like reading about movies and how they impact your day-to-day.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ Goodreads reviews:</span>

On second thought I want to change my one line review to this, although I wouldn't say the silliest. Mr Dani Filth and his sicarios are definitely on the top ten though!
