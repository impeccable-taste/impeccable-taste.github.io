<span class="reviewsection">Premise: </span> John Carpenter's masterpiece and objectively the best horror movie ever, ***John Carpenter's The Thing***, but told from the perspective of The Thing, from ***John Carpenter's The Thing***. Ah, the old switcharoo!

This is a short story by Peter Watts that you can read [here](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/).<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> definitely, it's a quick read.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Surprisingly, no. What the hell?!?

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> oh *hell yeah* this was really great.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> It only loses half a point because it tries to answer the Question That Should Be Left Unanswered. My favourite thing of Spooktober 2024 so far.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> well, not trying to relitigate this but instead of finishing like that, the last sentence should be something like "*I guess we are... **Peter Watt's The Things**...*"

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ some reddit guy:</span>
> Do I need to have watched the movie before I read this? All I know is that it's about a monster from Antarctica.

A sentence that makes me fill a mixture of sadness and impending doom.
