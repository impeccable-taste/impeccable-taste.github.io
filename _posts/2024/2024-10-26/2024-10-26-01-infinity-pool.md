<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Alex Skarsgård, his eternally sad face and his wife are on holidays who knows where. They meet the always eyebrowless Mia Goth and they have an car accident (not exactly at the same time, there is a lot of stuff happening before then). So they're introduced to some weird legislation and this is a Cronenberg Jr movie, of course from here on things get a bit, eh, welp.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> No.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> A fantastic homage to ***Ichi the Killer's*** very first scene.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> Mia Goth is quickly becoming one of my favourite horror actors and I love that she has a hilarious name. It's like a ***Mortadelo*** character, your surname decides what you need to do in life - Muchapastez, Cerebrin, etc<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I would add more references to Takashi Miike's filmography. It's not like we're going to run out of movies to quote, after all.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDb trivia:</span>
> This is the second movie in which Alexander Skarsgård plays a writer who hasn't sold a lot of books. The other is ***Godzilla vs. Kong***.

Man, first the books don't sell, then godzilla steps on the bookshop. Sometimes you just can't win.
