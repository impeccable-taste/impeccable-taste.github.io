<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> The thrilling conclusion to the cosmic horror manga adaptation where "horrible pacing" and "extremely cheap animation" were the surprise guests!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yeah.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> oh, *take a wild guess*.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>
{% include the-end-no-moral.html %}
<span class="reviewsection">Okay, more:</span> In a sense the ending was kind of fitting for the show quality. Don't bother.<br/>

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about ~~the IMDb trivia~~ Junji Ito:</span><br/>
Junji Ito has some really funny short stories about how he loves his cats drawn in his usual style. Really recommended.
