<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> kind of a ridiculous premise where we are supposed to think that 1992's Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn looked old and desperately needed to take some elixir of eternal youth to patch things up, but it's played for laughs so it's okay. Anyway, it's a bad idea to drink stuff like that, movies have taught me.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> I thought it was, but...<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Unfortunately no. That's a great title.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> arguably one of Bruce Willis' finest performances.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> still hilarious, the practical effects still look great, all three main actors are amazingly on point and yeah it's extremely light on the story department but who cares.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span>

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>

If you go to the Pictures section of this movie's IMDB entry you will find out that someone has uploaded the whole scene where the mysterious Lisle von Rhuman is getting out of the bath and you see her butt basically frame-by-frame.<br/>I bet that person's VHS tracking was kind of bonkers around that part of the movie.
