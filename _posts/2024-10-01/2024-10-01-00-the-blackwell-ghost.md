<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> "This is a real documentary about the existence of ghosts"<br/>
(kinda spoiled by the fact that it appears as "The Blackwell Ghost 1" on prime and you can see there are eight of them)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Hell yeah under an hour!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Nope.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> bold of you to start your mockumentary with a quote about boring documentaries, way to set the tone.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> eeeeeeeeh not great. It does nothing original.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I thought the wife's matter-of-factly ways were funny so let's have more of her constantly questioning how stupid her husband's whole thing is. Imagine being married to that guy, geez.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> The hat Clay wears in his plan has appeared in another one of his 'found' footage films.

Ah, my friend... this is what young people call "Lore". Expect several way-too-long youtube essays (*shiver*) about the complexities of this thing.
