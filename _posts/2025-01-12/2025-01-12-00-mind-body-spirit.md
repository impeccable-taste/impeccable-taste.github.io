<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Anya just inherited a bigass house from her completely estranged grandma and that allows her to focus on her apparent goal in life: become a failing youtube yoga instructor. Just when she's starting her first recording, she finds a hidden door... that kept like, half of the house behind it, a million weird occult things and specially a book/grimoire her grandma wrote for her. No red flags at all.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Several times and since this is a youtube thing, they're looking into the camera when they do. Full marks.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> bold of you to spell out the "twist" before the first ten minutes, movie.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> it's a pity they do not really stick to the found footage/screenlife format because when they do it really works. I admit I have a soft spot for the genre when it is very clearly low budget.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I found the main character's dumbness funny ("oh what's this, a really old dusty bottle with herbs? Imma prepare some tea and see what's what" -paraphrased, but something that actually happens) so maybe they could have embraced it even harder, go full ham at times, etc.

<span class="reviewsection">If I was in the movie, how long would it take me to leave?</span> The very moment the hidden door opens, so around five minutes in, tops. I wouldn't get to see the book and I would live a very long, not-cursed life.
