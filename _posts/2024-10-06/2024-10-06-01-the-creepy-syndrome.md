<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span>
> The Creepy Syndrome is an anthology that offers several psychological horror stories, with different pixel art and retro 1 bit, 8bit, gameboy, etc. styles. Stories of a disturbed mind that intertwine with each other while being analysed by a mysterious psychiatrist.

<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> I suppose if you try to complete it yeah.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Not during my playthrough.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> wonky, predictable and barely trying to do anything with the whole "*it works like an old timey game!*" premise, along with one of the lousiest english translations i've seen in a while.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Full dark, no stars.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> hire a translator or at least a proofreader, goodness gracious.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDB trivia~~ steam reviews:</span>
One of the reviews brought up ***Faith**** and hey that was a fun satanic panic 80s slock game. Surprisingly most reviews for this crap are positive?
