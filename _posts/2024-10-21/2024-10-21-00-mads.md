<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> A french teen decides to try some weird "I don't know what this is" drug right before:
- going to a party and
- picking up an injured woman

he does not do those in that order, and also he gets to learn about french cuisine.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Yes! YES!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No, and to be honest I don't have a clue of what the title means.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>
![WINNERS DON'T USE DRUGS](winners.png)<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> it suffers from having waaaaay too many scenes where a character goes from point A to point B but the rest is pretty wild.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I actually enjoyed a lot the gimmick of changing the POV character we're following, so maybe more of that and less of driving.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>

The only trivia they have is wrong so I don't know what to tell you this time.
