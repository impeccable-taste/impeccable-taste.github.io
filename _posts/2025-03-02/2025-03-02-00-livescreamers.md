<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> This is somehow a sequel to ***[Livescream]({% post_url 2024-10-22/2024-10-22-01-livescream %})***, a movie I watched during [SPOOKTOBER 2024]({% link tags/spooktober-2024/index.html %}), a movie I didn't really like that much but I refuse to learn any lessons.<br/>Anyhoo, you know how it goes: you download a game that has a reputation of being cuuuuursed, then your friends start dying. The difference this time is that we are not just dealing with a single fat dude on his room, this time it's a whole group of streamers together!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> It's about that or very close<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> No! What the hell?!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span>Some of the most obnoxious, annoying, tiring people on earth are professional streamers, and incidentally this piece of cinema stars a group of those.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Somehow this makes the original movie feel better in comparison, if anything because it was way shorter and it only got extremely dumb with the Dramatic Stuff Out Of Nowhere by the last fifteen/twenty minutes. It's clear the writer/director has tried to uh give the characters slightly more depth than the charisma black hole from the first movie, but... no luck there, no, and maybe it was better to just have the one dumb character and not uh, the lovely group here. That said, I had fun reading letterboxd reviews where people were REALLY mad at the "woke casting" so uh I guess we'll always have that.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> the game should be way cheesier than that and THEN it would at least be charming. Also repeating my previous recommendation of using Unity instead for the extra spook factor. Also maybe show at least ONE of the kills on screen.<br/>Okay, that was three things.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ movie credits:</span> I counted at least 11 people with the title "executive producer" on the movie, which I guess means this was funded by some kickstarter kind of deal thing and that was the top tier reward.
