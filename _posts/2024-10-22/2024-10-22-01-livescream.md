<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> what if this crappy twitch stream could KILL YOU and YOUR AUDIENCE of 200 people!? All those creepypastas were sorta true oh no! i'm not kidding when i say the movie starts with a "made with Unreal Engine 5" logo because part of the thing is that you're seeing someone play some true unreal store assetcore game.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> it's an hour long but it feels like a lot longer.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yuuuup.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> This is ***Ready Player One*** levels of "oh i get the reference" with exactly as much of the charm (none).<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> my ~~frie~~ acquaintance recommended it and i'm never trusting her opinion again.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> To make the film way scarier, my suggestion for the writer is to start the movie with "made with... *UNITY*"

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> The film is comprised of three long takes stitched together with hidden cuts

Also the chat lines sometimes appear even before the thing they're replying to is said. Friends, I don't think this was an actual live stream.
