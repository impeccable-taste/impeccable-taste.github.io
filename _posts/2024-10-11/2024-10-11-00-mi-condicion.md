<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Late at night, this lady is waiting for the bus and ends up talking with a dude at the bus stop, oooor more specifically she ends up *being talked to* by that dude who apparently cannot get a hint.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> yup, 11 minutes.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes!

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Some of the least credible dialogue ever in what amounts to a cheesy creepypasta!<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> The redeeming quality is they say the movie title, and it's only 11 minutes long. It coulbe shorter tho?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> You've got a ton of options here but I'm going to say they should dare make the two characters become FRIENDS and maybe even SUPERHERO and SIDEKICK.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the IMDB trivia:</span>
> Did you know... if you stacked a million elephants one on top of each other you not only wouldn't reach the moon but also all of them would die?

<small>(there was no imdb trivia or reviews so this is what you get)</small>
