<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> A collection of around 80 horror movie reviews, the movies are from 1956 to 1974 and as you might guess you get both good ones and not great ones! The guy's surname is what goes on a pizza.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> Well, it's a chonky boy.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> It is printed in the cover! Otherwise, no.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Not only it is very interesting and funny, the writer also adds random unrelated trivia to the reviews so I kept saying "*haha oh you*" all the time because game recognizes game.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Do you like reading about movies? If so, go for it! If not, what the hell are you doing here?<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> I think the author and I should shake hands, become good friends, maybe fight crime together??? haha just a joke.... *unless...?*

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDB trivia~~ Amazon reviews:</span>
> Contents aside, a low quality printed by Amazon thing pretending to be a book

wait, so... did I buy a *mimic*???=?Â¿
