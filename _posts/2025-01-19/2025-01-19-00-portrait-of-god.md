<span class="reviewsection">Premise:</span> Mia is a young, very religious lady who is preparing a presentation about a ventablack painting where some people say they see god - not Mia, though, she sees nothing there.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Under 90 minutes?</span> 7 very tight minutes.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Do they say the title?</span> Yes, it's the name of the painting and presentation after all.

<span class="reviewsection">One sentence review:</span> Powerpoint continues to be the scariest thing in the world.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">Rating:</span> Surprisingly enjoyable, a definite improvement over your usual crappy youtube horror short. Some really subtle unsettling stuff happening too.<br/>
<span class="reviewsection">A simple way to improve it:</span> if I was Mia I would have randomly interrupted the presentation several times going "wait can you see-?! BOO! Haha not really, just a joke...... *unless*...?" to lighten the mood. Religious people are very uptight sometimes.

<span class="reviewsection">Trivia about the ~~IMDb trivia~~ Letterboxd reviews:</span>
> Above all things, a film about the importance of always winging your presentations

I wish I had thought of this review first!
